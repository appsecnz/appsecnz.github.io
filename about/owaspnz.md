# About OWASP New Zealand

The OWASP New Zealand Chapter has been active since 2007. In addition to supporting and participating in the annual [OWASP New Zealand Day](https://appsec.org.nz/conference) conference, we organise local Meetups and training events throughout the year.

The chapter leaders are [Kim Carter](mailto:kim.carter@owasp.org) (Christchurch), [Kirk Jackson](mailto:kirk.jackson@owasp.org)
(Wellington), and [John DiLeo](mailto:john.dileo@owasp.org) (Auckland).
