# AppSec New Zealand Policies

**AppSec New Zealand does not endorse or recommend any commercial products, processes, services, or vendors. This allows our community to remain vendor-neutral, sharing the wisdom of the best minds in application security throughout New Zealand.**

## Anti-Harassment Policy

AppSec New Zealand is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.

Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion and actions such as deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Exhibitors in the Sponsor Exhibition Area, Sponsor Demo Room, or other conference activities are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing, uniforms, or costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers may take appropriate action, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately.
Conference staff will be available to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.

## Privacy Policy

AppSec NZ is committed to ensuring the privacy of event participants is protected. AppSec NZ will not sell or otherwise distribute participants’ personal information to third parties (including, but not limited to, sponsors and partner organisations), unless we have obtained their permission or are required by law to do so.

AppSec New Zealand Conference sponsors are advised that all conference attendees will be asked for their consent to inclusion on registration lists (containing *only* names and email addresses) shared with sponsors and will be included only if such consent is given.

During the course of conference registration and related communication, AppSec NZ may collect the following information:

* Name
* Job title/Role
* Contact information, including email address
* Demographic information such as postcode, preferences, and interests

We collect this information to communicate with participants about the event and related matters. Additionally, we hope to better understand the interests and needs of our community.
