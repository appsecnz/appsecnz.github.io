## Course Description

Building security into the software development and management practices of a company can be a daunting task. There are many elements to the equation: company structure, different stakeholders, technology stacks, tools and processes, and so forth. Implementing software assurance can have a significant impact on the organization. Yet, trying to achieve this without a good framework is most likely leading to just marginal and unsustainable improvements. OWASP SAMM gives you a structural and measurable framework to do just that. It enables you to formulate and implement a strategy for software security that is tailored to the risk profile of your organization. 

The goal of this one-day training, which is conceived as a mix of presentations and interactive workshops, is for the participants to get a more in-depth view of and practical feel for the OWASP SAMM model. The training is set up in three parts:

* In the first part, we present an overview of the model, and review the similarities and differences with other models. The five Business Functions - Governance, Design, Implementation, Verification, and Operations - are explained. Furthermore, different constituent elements (e.g., metrics) are discussed and the overall usage scenarios of the model are explained. 
* Next, approximately half a day will be spent doing an actual SAMM evaluation of your organization (or one that you have worked for). We will go through an evaluation of all the SAMM domains and discuss the results in the group. This will give all participants a good indication of the organizationâ€™s maturity in software assurance. In the same effort, we will define a target model for your organization and identify the most important challenges in getting there. 
* The final part of the training will be dedicated to specific questions or challenges that you are facing about secure development in your organization. In this group discussion, experiences will be shared among participants to address these questions. 

In case you haven't started a secure software initiative in your organization yet, this training should provide you with the necessary foundations and ideas to do so. Be prepared for the highly effective and applicable treatment of this large domain! 

And, in case you're concerned about confidentiality issues, all participants are expected to adhere to the Chatham House Rule.
