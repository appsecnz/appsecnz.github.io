## Course Description

So you know the basics of threat modelling. Care to put that to the test?

This class is an experiential threat model training. We'll set up a scenario, have the class team up to create the threat model, and see if the proposed mitigations would have caught a specific threat that the instructors have knowledge of.

We'll go through one together after which the class will be challenged to complete 2-to-4 more threat modelling challenges, to see if you can capture the flag!

This class will include a brief review/introduction of threat modelling for those ranging from some skill to more advanced modellers. 

Everyone from pen-testers, to auditors, to compliance nerds, to software engineers are more than welcome to join in and participate.
