# Conference Code of Conduct

## OWASP New Zealand Day 2024

We want to make the OWASP New Zealand Day conference a welcoming environment for all attendees. To that end, we would like to remind you that all activities associated with this event are subject to [AppSec New Zealand's Conference Policies](https://appsec.org.nz/about/policies.html). At their core, these policies are intended to promote and maintain an inclusive, welcoming environment for all participants - actions detrimental to that environment are unwelcome.

Speakers, trainers and sponsors have all been reminded of these policies, and are expected to abide by them like all attendees.

**You can report any issues through our** [Code of Conduct Reporting Form](https://forms.gle/z8AUa5YpCNwn9yHe9){: target="_blank" }

If you are comfortable doing so, you can also seek help by approaching volunteers wearing distinctive blue t-shirts, particularly **John, Austin, or Anneke**, who make up our Code of Conduct Team and will be introduced at the start of the conference.

**In an emergency, please contact the New Zealand Police on 111 or AUT Security on 09 921 9997.**
