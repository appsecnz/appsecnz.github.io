# COVID Contingency Plan

## OWASP New Zealand Day 2022

### Our Approach

The OWASP New Zealand Day planning team recognise the importance of holding an in-person event, if possible. For this reason, we've elected to go forward with planning on the assumption Auckland will be in COVID Alert Level 1 in February. We're inviting trainers to propose in-person or online training, as suits their circumstances and comfort level with in-person gatherings.

Conversely, we must also recognise there's a significant chance Auckland **won't** be at Alert Level 1 in February. To allow for this possibility, we have confirmed contingency dates with AUT, in July. If necessary, we'll reschedule the conference to the contingency dates; however, we will not reschedule a second time. If Auckland is at Alert Level 2 or higher in July, we'll modify the conference's *format*, instead. AUT's campuses are *closed* at Alert Level 3 or 4, which would require the conference to shift to a fully online format; at Alert Level 2, we can accommodate a smaller in-person gathering to create a "broadcast" event (subject to the government's updated 'Delta Level 2' restrictions), with main conference delegates participating remotely and most in-person training proceeding as planned. 

A key element of our plan is that all portions of the conference will be broadcast via live stream from a dedicated media site, so anyone concerned about taking part in person has the option to participate remotely, regardless of the COVID Alert Level. Similarly, we can accommodate a limited number of remote presentations, even at Level 1, so we can accommodate any speakers with such concerns.

Disposable face masks and hand sanitiser will be made available throughout the conference, to help everyone stay safe.

### Key Milestones

* **Planned Conference Dates:** Tuesday - Friday, 15-18 February 2022
* **Contingency Dates:** Tuesday - Friday, 5-8 July 2022
* **Decision Points:**
  * **17 January 2022** (four weeks before the conference): Go/No-Go decision on planned conference dates
  * **7 June 2022** (four weeks before our contingency dates): Format decision for contingency conference dates
  
### Decision Stage One - Planned Dates

* On 17 January, four (4) weeks before the planned beginning of the conference, if Auckland is at COVID Alert Level 2 or higher, the conference team will coordinate with AUT's event management team to reschedule the conference to our contingency dates, 5-8 July.
  * If Auckland goes into a higher Alert Level after 17 January, but before the start of the conference (15 February), the conference team will immediately revert to the contingency dates.
  * If such a decision is made, all stakeholders - sponsors, speakers, trainers, volunteers, and delegates - will be notified promptly by email, and public announcements will be made on the conference website and through social media channels.
* If Auckland is at COVID Alert Level 1+ (i.e., with gathering size restrictions), the conference will proceed as scheduled, with registration limits adjusted to comply with government requirements.

### Decision Stage Two - Contingency Dates

In the event the conference is rescheduled to the contingency dates, the following strategy applies to the event on those dates.

On 7 June, four (4) weeks before the beginning of the conference on it's contingency dates, the conference team will review the COVID Alert Level in Auckland, and proceed as follows:
* If Auckland is at Alert Level 2 as of 7 June, or goes into Level 2 between 7 June and 4 July, the conference team will coordinate with AUT's event management team to convert the event to a "broadcast" format:
  * The two main conference tracks will be broadcast from separate rooms, with each track treated as its own 'bubble.' Volunteers and speakers will minimise inter-bubble contact and the total number of people (speakers, volunteers, and university staff) involved with each track will be kept at or below the 'Delta Level 2' gathering limit.
  * If the gathering limit permits, a small number of Auckland-based conference delegates will be selected randomly and invited to be part of the "studio audience. Four groups will be invited - Track One/Track Two and Thursday/Friday - and will be required to remain within their designated 'bubble' the entire time they're on site.
  * Total in-person attendance for the Pre-Conference Training on Tuesday and Wednesday (trainers, trainees, and volunteers) will be limited to the 'Delta Level 2' gathering limit, so some classes may be cancelled or moved online. 
  * If there are domestic travel restrictions (i.e., a 'border' around Auckland), speakers unable to travel to Auckland will be invited to present remotely.
  * The Sponsor Exhibition Area and Delegate Lounge will not operate.
  
* If Auckland is COVID Alert Level 3 or 4 as of 7 June, or goes into Level 3 or Level 4 between 7 June and 4 July, the conference team will coordinate with AUT's event management team to switch to a fully online event:
  * All speakers and session chairs will participate remotely.
  * Main conference delegates will participate online only.
  * Online training classes will proceed as scheduled.
  * In-person training classes will be either cancelled or moved online.
  * As the event will be entirely virtual, there will not be a Sponsor Exhibition Area or Delegate Lounge.
  
### Decision Stage Three - During the Event

If the government announces a change in the COVID Alert Level for Auckland *during* the conference:

* Unless prohibited, we'll finish out the current day's programme. Any increased masking or physical separation requirements will be enforced immediately.
* The remainder of the event will be cancelled, to allow participants to make arrangements and get home before travel restrictions go into effect.
