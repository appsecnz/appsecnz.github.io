# Biohacking: The Invisible Threat

## Half-Day Interactive (Online) Training - OWASP New Zealand Day 2022

## Abstract

Security professionals won't allow users into their environment with hacking tools, so how do you address people with implants? People are the attack vector and the tool. The ability to compromise contactless technologies threatens both physical and digital security. How do you stop a Cyber threat from a human?

## Course Details 

**Dates:** Wednesday, 15 February 2022

**Time:** 8:45 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. (NZDT)

**Instructor:** Len Noe, [CyberArk Software](https://www.cyberark.com/)   

**Course Fee:** NZ $225.00 (plus GST and ticketing fees)

**Registration Site:** [https://events.humanitix.com/owaspnz2022-training](https://events.humanitix.com/owaspnz2022-training)

## Course Description

Biohackers exist and walk among us. Most security professionals would not allow users into their environment with offensive security tools. How do you address individuals who have surgically implanted such devices into their bodies?

I have multiple sub-dermal implants that include a variety of NFC, HID/Prox and RFiD devices. This allows me to become the attack vector. In this workshop, I provide a brief overview of the types of bio-implants on the market and share various case studies on the potential damage malicious biohackers can inflict.

I also demonstrate how I am able to quickly compromise loosely connected devices and open a Reverse TCP shell to a command-and-control (CnC) server, through my attack L3pr@cy, in under three minutes.

Finally, I show how I steal HID Proximity Card Data and write that back to the implant. This avoids any physical evidence of a breach. This also allows me to gain access to data as well as physical access to secured locations.

As security professionals, we must anticipate the unknown. These include any individuals that enter our facilities or are simply around us in public. These types of attacks are becoming more common. A majority of security community are not aware they exist. Discussions on what was once thought to be science-fiction are now science fact.

Through continuing education on Phishing and social engineering attacks, tightening MDM restrictions, endpoint management, behavioral analytics, least privilege and privileged access, we can take preventive measures around the threats we canâ€™t see.
