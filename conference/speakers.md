### Application Security and Cheese   
*Steve Esler - Aura Information Security*   
Track One   
Thursday, 15:05


#### Abstract

Everyone loves cheese, right? This talk will apply the Swiss cheese model to AppSec, each cheese slice is a security activity, a layer of the defenses there to reduce the risk of threats becoming reality and prevent vulnerabilities from various sources making their way into production systems.
 
#### Description

This talk leans on some of my background in aviation maintenance and safety software as aviation is one of the places where the Swiss cheese model originated. It has also been used more recently to model the COVID pandemic defenses. I will apply the model here to describe how we can use security activities in the application development lifecycle to reduce the risk of threats becoming a reality. Each slice of the cheese being a security activity, each hole being a gap in the defenses that a threat might slip through. It will describe what in application security context active and latent failures are and in this context how vulnerabilities can relate to the four failure domains of the model: organizational influences (poor security culture, priorities elsewhere, lack of investment), supervision (training and guidance, documentation), preconditions (lack of controls, complex environments) and specific acts (activities of the threat actor, poor security practices).

No new ground-breaking security activities here; just all the good stuff championed by OWASP and explaining how these can fit into common software development lifecycles. Covering about how threats might still slip through, what might move the slices making the holes align or new ones appear so a threat could get through and become a vulnerability by looking at some of the limitations of each activity. What could be the next slice of cheese that might catch the threat and avoid an incident later in the development lifecycle. Share some of my experience in understanding when to do each activity and the problems I've previously encountered in working with development teams to introduce application security programs. Telling a story of some of the things I have seen work in practice, some that haven't worked so well and questions that often come up when planning and implementing a set of security activities. It's not a one size fits all, some activities will suit individual contexts better than others. How layering is key both to provide defense in depth but also to enable a gradual rollout as the activities cost both effort and money. Delving briefly into what can be automated and what is best accepted as a manual process. Also looking at some of the Human Factors that influence the effectiveness of the defenses.

#### Speaker Biography

**Steve Esler** has a background in 15 years as a web developer working on greenfield projects and initiating changes in development technologies prototyping new systems that I then helped release to market. The last 5 years as a developer I spent working with the Royal Air Force in the UK on an aircraft maintenance and support software. After meeting all the goals Iâ€™d set myself for a development career I switched to Cyber Security to take on a new challenge. And there are possibly no wider fields and challenges than Cyber Security! Gained a Masters in Cyber security then went out to industry to gain some experience starting with a short stint as a pen tester then moving on to working securing on IoT, SCADA electronics systems and vulnerability management for a custom Linux distro at Honeywell. At Honeywell I was working with Teams across the world to secure both hardware, operating systems and applications. Through Honeywell, I picked up some great experience working within a very mature and successful software and system security program. Also gaining some professional certificates along the way. I then worked with a large financial company in the UK on creating an application security framework before moving to New Zealand with my young family at the start of 2021.
