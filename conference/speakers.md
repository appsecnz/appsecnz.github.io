### "Better than Guessing": The Efficacy and Accuracy of SAST and SCA Tools   
*Raafey Khan - Datacom*

#### Abstract

The OWASP Benchmark Project is a Java test suite designed to evaluate the accuracy, coverage, and speed of automated software vulnerability detection tools. To enhance the picture the Benchmark provides, we’ve used open source and commercial Static Application Security Testing (SAST) as well as Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to scan a number of our own applications.

In this talk, we’ll talk through: How SAST and SCA operate, and the various scanning techniques used by these tools How commercial SAST vendors fared against the OWASP benchmark, and whether the benchmark false positive rate results were in-line with the results of scanning our own apps How various commercial SCA options compare to the open source OWASP Dependency Check tool What value (beyond scan output) paid tools provide compared to their open-source counterparts.

#### Speaker Biography

An eternal security optimist (forgive him, he is young), Raafey has been helping organisations in NZ and the UK understand their cyber risk and why they should at-least try to embed security into their development processes.

As a founding member of Datacom’s AppSec division, Raafey will attempt to do more of the same, with a real focus on automating everything and making security stupidly simple.

### OWASP SAMM: Status and Roadmap   
*OWASP SAMM Project Team*

#### Abstract

The OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) enables you to formulate and implement a strategy for software security that is tailored to the risk profile of your organisation. In this talk, we give an overview of the new release of the SAMM model. After 10 years since its first conception, it was important to align it with today's development practices. We will cover a number of topics in the talk:

* the core structure of the model, redesigned and extended to align with modern development practices;
* the measurement model, enhanced to cover both coverage and quality; and 
* the new security practice streams where the SAMM activities are grouped in maturity levels. 

We will demonstrate using the new SAMM2 Toolbox to measure the maturity of an example development team and how you can create a roadmap of activities.

Our new SAMM project "CI/CD" pipeline allows us to iterate much faster. We plan to push new SAMM improvements over the coming months. During this talk we will share our short-, medium-, and long-term plans for OWASP SAMM and hope to capture your feedback and requests for improvement.

### Session Three (15:25 - 16:55)

### Your Browser Wants You to Be Secure   
*Kirk Jackson - RedShield*

#### Abstract

The makers of Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and other browsers are constantly pushing the envelope in browser security, with new features recently released and under development. Many of these features are simple to incorporate into your application, and this talk will help you keep up with the moving target of staying safe on the Internet.

Over the past 10 years there have been numerous HTTP headers, sandboxing and protection mechanisms added to browsers - so many that it's hard to keep up! It's possible that the best defences you learned in 2011 have been bettered by the new stuff rolling out each month in 2021.

In this talk you'll learn about the old, with a focus on the new and shiny. We will focus on those protections that are available now, and proven by others to work – and have a quick point towards future security enhancements that are coming in the future.

#### Speaker Biography

Kirk Jackson works at RedShield, leads the OWASP Wellington Meetup, and has previously helped organise the annual OWASP NZ Day in Auckland.

### A Hacker's View of DoS Attacks   
*Dave Robinson - ZX Security*

#### Abstract

DoS attacks are a topic at the front of a lot people's minds at the moment. This talk will examine how a hacker selects targets within an organisation, with a goal of causing the greatest business interruption.

Attackers can find juicy targets in more ways than you would initially think. A range of discovery techniques will be presented. People watching this talk will not be left hanging, as it will finish with how you can protect your assets from DoS attacks (Spoiler: a CDN, WAF, or DoS Scrubbing are not magical cures on their own).

### Bug Hunting with Static Analysis Tools   
*Moss Lilley - Xero*

#### Abstract

For security to keep up with the speed of development, we can no longer be gate keepers. This requires building secure defaults and enforcing them through automated checks.

The earlier developers know they've turned off a security control the better. We'll have a look into how we can provide feedback on this to developers in the IDE with a bit of **grep**. Grepping for bugs can return a lot of false positives, we'll have a look into using CodeQL to track user input into HTTP requests and *hopefully* find a SSRF in a web application.

#### Speaker Biography

Moss eats, breathes, sleeps.

He's been working at Xero for the last two years learning how to wrangle web apps and the cloud, trying to create secure defaults to keep pace with the speed of developers. He loves to hear about automating security, war stories and skiing.

### Fuzzing: An Introduction to Fuzzing and How It Relates to App Security   
*Seth Berger - GitLab*

#### Abstract

How does a photo render your phone useless? How could one of the worst SSL vulnerabilities in history have been discovered years earlier, during initial development?

Learn what fuzzing is and learn about the tools and techniques used in fuzzing, and how it can be used to secure your applications.

### XXE: Why It's Still in the [OWASP] Top 10   
*Sam Shute - Quantum Security*

#### Abstract

XML External Entities (XXEs) have been in the OWASP Top Ten since 2017, however they have existed as a vulnerability class for approximately two decades. Entities within XML can be used to do lots of fun things as an attacker, such as causing a Denial-of-Service, stealing files, or even creating a backdoor.

This talk will cover the basics of what XXEs are, how to exploit them, and importantly for developers, how to prevent them.

#### Speaker Biography

Sam is a Principal Security Consultant with Quantum Security in Wellington. His day-to-day work revolves mostly around running Quantum's technical consulting team, but occasionally he gets out of the office to compromise applications and networks all around New Zealand.

### Session Two (13:30 - 14:55)

### Going Above and Beyond   
*Karan Sharma*

#### Abstract

While the OWASP Top 10 is a great baseline for WebApp security, I'd like to cover some of the attacks that aren't addressed there. These attacks are gaining lots of attention so it's time to shed some light on: HTTP Request Smuggling; JavaScript Prototype Pollution Attack; PostMessage Attack; and GraphQL API Hacking.

For each attack, we'll look at: the vulnerability that's being exploited; real-world exploit examples; mitigating controls; and lessons learned (where they have been).

#### Speaker Biography

*Kim Carter - BinaryMist*

#### Abstract

Developers / Engineers know that a build pipeline is an essential part of creating robust and reliable software, but what to put in it? This talk covers the creation of **purpleteam** from PoC to Alpha release, and why it's an ideal fit for the security regression testing slot of your build pipeline.

Let me take you on the journey of trials, errors, and lessons learnt from getting a web app/API security regression testing proof of concept (PoC) to the next stage (alpha release).

In 2019, I gave a talk at OWASP NZ Day on a security regression testing PoC I had developed based on developer feedback. Since then, on top of a normal day job, I’ve been working on this project with every spare minute of time.
