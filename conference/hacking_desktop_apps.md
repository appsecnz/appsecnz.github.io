## Course Overview

This course is a 100% hands-on deep dive into the OWASP&reg; Security Testing Guide and relevant items of the OWASP&reg; Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS), so this course covers and goes beyond the OWASP&reg; Top Ten.

Long are the days since desktop apps were written in Delphi. What is common between Microsoft Teams, Skype, Bitwarden, Slack and Discord? All of them are written in Electron: JavaScript on the client.

Modern Desktop apps share traditional attack vectors and also introduce new opportunities to threat actors. This course will teach you how to review modern desktop apps, showcasing Node.js and Electron but using techniques that will also work against any other desktop app platform. Ideal for Penetration Testers, Desktop app Developers as well as everybody interested in JavaScript/Node.js/Electron app security.

All action, no fluff, improve your security analysis workflow and immediately apply these gained skills in your workplace, packed with exercises, extra mile challenges and CTF, self-paced and suitable for all skill levels, with continued education via unlimited email support and lifetime access to training portal with step-by-step video recordings and interesting apps to practice, including all future updates for free.

Course topics include:

* Review of Common Flaws in Source Code and at Runtime
* Desktop App Modification of Behavior Through Code/Configuration Changes
* Web & Desktop - Interception of Network Communication and MitM-proxy techniques to find security flaws in these platforms
* Platform-specific attack vectors against Modern Web apps & mitigation
* Platform-specific attack vectors against Modern Desktop apps & mitigation
* CTF Challenges for Attendants to Test Their Skills
