## 3 - 6 September 2024

## Auckland University of Technology (AUT) City Campus

-----

We are proud to present the 14th OWASP New Zealand Day conference, to be held at the Auckland University of Technology (AUT) City Campus on Thursday and Friday, September 5th and 6th, 2024. OWASP New Zealand Day is a two-day conference dedicated to web and application security, with an emphasis on secure architecture and development techniques to help Kiwi developers build more secure applications. The conference is presented by the [OWASP New Zealand Chapter](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-new-zealand/) and organised by [AppSec New Zealand Incorporated](../index.md).

There will be two presentation streams throughout the conference. The first stream will include introductory talks on application and information security topics, as well as on policy, compliance, and risk management. The second stream will primarily address deeper technical topics. Talks featuring OWASP projects and tools are particularly encouraged, as are talks by members of under-represented communities.

In addition to these principal streams, there will be a third, smaller "stream," supporting sponsor presentations, demos of OWASP tools, and interest/user group meetings. Diamond, Platinum, and Gold Sponsors will be given priority for time slots in this "stream." Further details will be published closer to the date, regarding opportunities for other groups to present.

Who is the Conference for?

* Web Developers
* Security Professionals and Enthusiasts
* Program and Project Managers
* Business Analysts
* Requirements Analysts
* Software Testers

## Conference Live Stream

All three streams of the conference (Track 1, Track 2, and the Sponsor Demos) will be live streamed on the day. Access information for the conference live-stream will be provided to registered delegates, as details are finalised.

### Conference Special Features

**Lunch Service -** This year, we will again be working with the catering team at AUT, to provide an on-site option for lunch each day, at an additional cost. Lunch will be $30 per person (plus GST and booking fees) and pre-purchase will be required (as part of your conference and/or training registration). Complimentary lunch will be provided to speakers, trainers, and sponsor exhibitors. We are offering this service as a convenience - you are, as always, welcome to explore the area and find lunch on your own.

**Delegate Lounge -** Throughout the main conference on Thursday and Friday, we'll have a Delegate Lounge available in Room WA224A. The entrance to the Delegate Lounge is from the Sponsor Exhibition Area. The Delegate Lounge is a great place to catch up with colleagues or add a few pieces to one of the ongoing **LEGO Build** projects.   

**Delegate Lounge Hours:**   

   * Thursday (5 September): 10:15 a.m. - 6:00 p.m.
   * Friday (6 September): 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m.

**LEGO Build -** In a corner of the **Delegate Lounge**, we'll have a table set up, for conference participants to help out with building a number of LEGO sets throughout the event. The conference A/V team will create a stop-motion video of the builds during the conference, and we'll view the finished video during the Closing Session on Friday.

As an added bonus, some lucky conference delegate(s) will go home with LEGO sets, as prizes in our Door Prize Draw at the Closing Session of the conference. All sets *completed* during the conference will be included in the top prize, while each incomplete/unopened set will be drawn as a separate, 'lesser' prize.

To be eligible to win LEGO sets, or other door prizes, you'll need to visit with each of our sponsors and have them stamp your entry card. Drop boxes for completed entry cards will be available at the Conference Information Desks (on Level 3 and in the Sponsor Exhibition area).
