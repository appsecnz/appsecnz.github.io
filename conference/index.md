We are proud to announce the first annual AppSec New Zealand Conference, to be held at the University of Auckland on Friday and Saturday, February 12th and 13th, 2021. The AppSec New Zealand Conference is presented in collaboration with the [OWASP New Zealand Chapter](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-new-zealand/) and is a two-day conference dedicated to web and application security, with an emphasis on secure architecture and development techniques to help Kiwi developers build more secure applications.

There will be two conference streams throughout the conference. The first stream will include introductory talks on application and information security topics, as well as on policy, compliance, and risk management. The second stream will primarily address deeper technical topics. Talks featuring OWASP projects and tools are particularly encouraged, as are talks by members of under-represented communities.

In addition to these principal streams, there will be a third, smaller "stream," supporting sponsor presentations, demos of OWASP tools, and interest/user group meetings. Platinum and Gold Sponsors will be given priority for time slots in this "stream;" further details will be published closer to the date, regarding opportunities for other groups to present.

Who is it for?

* Web Developers
* Security Professionals and Enthusiasts
* Program and Project Managers
* Business Analysts
* Requirements Analysts
* Software Testers
