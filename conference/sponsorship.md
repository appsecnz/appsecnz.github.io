# Call for Sponsorships

## AppSec New Zealand Conference 2021

The 2021 AppSec New Zealand Conference will be held in Auckland on Friday and Saturday, 12-13 February, 2021, and is a security conference entirely dedicated to
application security. The conference is once again being hosted by the University of Auckland with their support and assistance. The AppSec New Zealand Conference is a very low-cost event, and requires sponsor support to help be an instructive and quality event for the New Zealand community. AppSec New Zealand is strictly not for profit. The sponsorship money will be used to help make the AppSec New Zealand Conference a compelling, and valuable experience for all attendees.

Sponsorship funds collected are used for things such as:

* **Venue -** Room use and on-site management fees
* **Name tags -** We feel that getting to know people within the New Zealand community is important, and name tags make that possible
* **Promotion -** We would like to reach a wider audience, by utilising paid advertising and online promotion for the event
* **Printed Materials -** Printed materials will include participant badges (with agenda information), and information and room signage
* **Recognition Items -** We love our speakers and trainers, and wish to show them our appreciation with small gifts
* **Catering -** To promote a collegial environment for networking among application security professionals, we're scheduling three (3) catered tea breaks
* **Administration -** While we do our best to keep administrative and operating costs low, we do need to cover ongoing expenses, such as insurance, accounting services, and storage fees

## Facts

Last year, the conference's predecessor (OWASP New Zealand Day) was supported by 13 premier sponsors and attracted more than 800 attendees. Plenty of constructive (and positive!) feedback from the audience was received, and we are using this to make the conference more appealing to more people. For more information on the last New Zealand Day event, please visit: https://owasp.org/www-event-2020-NewZealandDay/.

The activities of AppSec New Zealand, including this conference, are organised to align with and support the educational objectives of the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Foundation and its local chapter, OWASP New Zealand ([owasp.org.nz](https://owasp.org.nz)). The OWASP New Zealand community is strong, with more than 500 people currently subscribed to the mailing list 
([sign up](https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-newzealand)). 

To lessen the potential impact of COVID-related restrictions on gatherings, the 2021 Conference will be limited to 500 total attendees.

AppSec conferences' regular attendees include IT project managers, IT security managers,
IT security consultants, Web application architects and developers, QA
managers, QA testers and system administrators.

## Exhibition Space

In 2020, the OWASP New Zealand Day team introduced the Sponsor Exhibition Area, with booth space provided as part of each sponsorship package. Some sponsors, however, didn't wish to make use of the space provided. For this year's conference, we've made the exhibition space an optional add-on, so sponsors can decide whether to have a booth.

|        |Platinum    |Gold    |Silver    |Bronze    |
|-------:|:----------:|:------:|:--------:|:--------:|
|**Booth Size**|**6m x 3m**|**3m x 3m**|**2m x 2.5m**|**2m x 2.5m**|
|**Seating**|3 tables<br>6 chairs|2 tables<br>4 chairs|1 table<br>2 chairs|1 table<br>2 chairs|
|**Rate**|$400|$300|$200|$200|

Each booth space will be provided one power strip, and all tables will be fully draped. Booths will be configured by the venue team on Thursday morning, and will be available for sponsor staff to set up after noon on Thursday. If desired, sponsors are welcome to staff their booths on Thursday afternoon, through the close of pre-conference training (5:30 p.m.).

**Optional Video Displays:** 

**65" TVs:** The venue's A/V support team can provide 65" HDMI-compatible displays on rolling stands, for use in sponsor exhibition booths. The cost is $395 each, which includes use of the display during the main conference (Friday and Saturday), delivery/pick-up, and on-site setup. Platinum and Gold Sponsor booths can accommodate two (2) displays, while Silver/Bronze Sponsor booths can accommodate one (1).

**Projector and Screen:** There is a permanently installed projector and screen, located in one corner of the Sponsor Exhibition Area. The option is available (on a first-in, first-served basis) for one Gold Sponsor to reserve that corner booth and use the projector and screen during the main conference (Friday and Saturday). The cost for this option is $450.

### Notes

**Training Passes:**

Our pre-conference training is planned to include a mix of half-day, one-day, and two-day classes. Each Premier Sponsor package includes a number of "Training Passes," each valid for one half-day of training for one person. 

  - One pass can be redeemed for a 100% discount on a half-day class, 50% discount on a one-day class, or 25% discount on a two-day class 
  - Passes may be combined - Use two for a 100% discount on a one-day class, or use up to four toward a two-day class
  - To redeem a pass, provide the name and email address of the pass's recipient, along with the class to which it should be applied. The recipient will be issued a single-use discount code, to use in registering for the specified class.
  - Sponsors are free to distribute these passes as they choose, provided they are not resold. If preferred, passes can be turned over to the conference's Diversity Fund committee, for award to applicants
  
**Reserved Conference Passes:**

Since attendance will be limited at the conference, a portion of the available registrations will be held back for direct issue to sponsor staff or sponsored attendees. Each sponsorship package specifies the number of reserved passes included. 

To claim these passes, sponsors must provide the names and email addresses of those to whom they should be issued, no later than two weeks before the event (Thursday, 28 January). After this date, unclaimed passes will be returned to the general registration pool.

**Sponsor Logos:**

  - Logos are to be provided by the respective sponsors, as digital files in both raster (JPEG, PNG) and vector (SVG) formats
  - Logos provided for inclusion on the website should be full colour
  - For lanyards and tote bags (including Platinum/Gold/Silver
    Sponsors), a single-colour version of the logo should also be
    provided, in a separate file. If a single-colour version of the logo
    is not provided by the sponsor, the AppSec New Zealand Conference Committee
    reserves the right to electronically convert the full-colour logo to
    a single-colour version, or omit the sponsor's logo from the
    imprinted items if that proves infeasible.

**Sponsor Banners:**

  - Lobby and stage-side banners are to be provided by the respective
    sponsors, must be free-standing, and their size is subject to
    approval by the AppSec New Zealand Conference Committee.
  - The conference venue includes two tracks, conducted in separate
    auditoriums; Platinum Sponsors may display one banner to the side of
    each auditorium's stage; Gold Sponsors may display a banner to the
    side of the stage in one auditorium. Gold Sponsors may express an
    auditorium preference, but final locations are at the discretion of
    the AppSec New Zealand Conference Committee.
  - There will be a maximum of five (5) sponsor banners displayed in
    each auditorium, with placement priority given to Platinum Sponsors.

  - Printed materials are limited in dimensions to A4 size - either a
    single sheet, printed on one or both sides; or an A4 booklet
