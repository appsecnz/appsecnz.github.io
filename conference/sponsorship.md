# Call for Sponsors

## 2022 OWASP New Zealand Day

The 2022 OWASP New Zealand Day conference will be held in Auckland on Thursday and Friday, 17-18 February, 2022. This event 
is unique among New Zealand security conferences, in that it's entirely dedicated to application security. AppSec New Zealand Incorporated is, once again, managing the logistics and finances for the event. This year, we have been able to secure a licensing arrangement with the OWASP Foundation, allowing us to return to the event's traditional "OWASP New Zealand Day" branding.

Due to scheduling conflicts at the University of Auckland, we have been unable to secure our usual venue. In 2022 and 2023, 
we'll be hosted at the Auckland University of Technology's city campus, in the Sir Paul Reeves (WG) Building. The shift to our alternative venue has both increased our costs and reduced the event's capacity (assuming COVID Alert Level 1) from 1,000 to 750.

We strive to keep the costs for delegates low, and provide financial support for students, unwaged, and members of under-represented groups. Thanks to the continuing generosity of our Premier Sponsors, we have been able to consistently deliver an  instructive, high-quality event for the New Zealand community. AppSec New Zealand is strictly not for profit and is a registered New Zealand charity (Charity Number CC59162). Sponsorship funds are used to make the OWAS New Zealand Day conference a compelling and valuable experience for all delegates.

Sponsorship funds collected are used for things such as:

* **Venue -** Room use and on-site management fees
* **Delegate Badges -** We feel that getting to know people within the New Zealand community is important, and name tags make that possible
* **Promotion -** We would like to reach a wider audience, by utilising paid advertising and online promotion for the event
* **Printed Materials -** Printed materials will include conference programs, badge lanyards, delegate tote bags, volunteer and delegate t-shirts, and information and room signage
* **Recognition Items -** We love our speakers and trainers, and wish to show them our appreciation with small gifts
* **Catering -** To promote a collegial environment for networking among application security professionals, we're scheduling three (3) catered tea breaks
* **Administration -** While we do our best to keep day-to-day administrative and operating costs low, we do need to cover ongoing expenses such as insurance, accounting services, and storage fees

With the change of venue, along with year-on-year increases to service fees and catering charges, the overall budget for this year's conference is approximately 25% larger than for last year's AppSec New Zealand Conference event. The rates for our existing Premier Sponsorship packages have been increased only slightly; the bulk of the increase will be covered by other changes we've made (delegate registration fees, revised training fee structure, etc.).

## Facts

The 2020 OWASP New Zealand Day was supported by 13 premier sponsors and attracted more than 800 delegates. For more information on previous OWASP New Zealand Day events, please visit the OWASP New Zealand Chapter's [website](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-new-zealand/). 

Attendance for the first [AppSec New Zealand Conference](/conference-2021), in February 2021, was a bit lower, with approximately 650 delegates attending in person. 2021 also marked our first experience with live-streaming the event, with approximately 300 live-stream registrations. Considering it was our first event under the new name, our first attempt at hosting a two-day conference - *and* the event ended just 30 hours before Auckland's first "snap lockdown" - we consider the event a great success. Those constraints notwithstanding, the AppSec New Zealand Conference was supported by 15 Premier Sponsors, which allowed us to provide travel and training assistance to 33 delegates, 

The activities of AppSec New Zealand, including this conference, are organised to align with and support the educational objectives of the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Foundation and its local chapter, OWASP New Zealand ([owasp.org.nz](https://owasp.org.nz)). The OWASP New Zealand community is strong, with more than 500 people currently subscribed to the mailing list 
([sign up](https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-newzealand)). 

Those who regularly attend AppSec conferences include IT project managers, IT security managers,
IT security consultants, Web application architects and developers, QA
managers, QA testers and system administrators.

Throughout its 12 years of operation under the local OWASP chapter, the OWASP New Zealand Day conference attracted more than 90% of its delegates and presenters from within New Zealand. Given the likelihood border restrictions will continue in place next February, we anticipate few or no delegates or presenters from outside New Zealand this year. Nonetheless, we anticipate pre-registrations for the conference will once again sell out, and on-the-day attendance will be between 650 and 750.

## About AppSec New Zealand

The conference is organised and conducted by AppSec New Zealand, a all-volunteer, NZ-based Incorporated Society (Registration #50041020, Charity Number CC59162). The primary purposes of AppSec New Zealand are to:

* organise and conduct application security conferences, training, and other educational events; and
* provide financial and other support for educational activities which advance awareness of, understanding of, and opportunities in application security.

## Premium Sponsorship Packages

### Highlights of Changes for 2022

This year, we've made a few adjustments to our Premier Sponsorship packages, to help meet the increased costs for the event:

* We've introduced a new, **Diamond** sponsorship level, of which only one (1) will be available
* We've increased the number of available **Platinum** sponsor spots from two (2) to three (3)
* For **Diamond** and **Platinum** sponsorships, exhibition space is included in the fee
* Each Premier Sponsor package includes a number of free conference passes and conference t-shirts ($40 value per person)

### Lego Build and Video Sponsorship

In addition to the tiered sponsorship packages detailed below, we've introduced an exciting new *a la carte* opportunity this year: A Lego Build Sponsorship! For the 2022 conference, we're adding an Delegate Lounge, adjacent to the Sponsor Exhibition Area. In the Delegate Lounge, conference participants will be able to take part in a group build of a Lego Star Destroyer [Lego Set #75252](https://www.lego.com/en-nz/product/imperial-star-destroyer-75252). 

Throughout the conference, the A/V team will capture time-sequenced photos of the build area, and will present a first-cut version of the stop-motion video during the closing session on Friday afternoon. The sponsor will be recognised at the beginning and end of the video, to be published on the OWASP New Zealand Chapter's [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWjcSSETjqhzBlVxXTW1zhg) and promoted through social media.

In addition, the sponsor will be invited to the stage to draw the first name in our prize giving, and that person (if present) will be awarded the completed model (a $1,500 value).

The fee for this one-of-a-kind *a la carte* sponsorship is **$4,500**, to cover the set purchase and video production costs. Other associated sponsor benefits are similar to those of a **Silver** sponsorship.

### Premier Sponsor Fees and Benefits

All amounts listed are in New Zealand dollars (NZD), and are exclusive of GST.

## Exhibition Space

In 2020, the OWASP New Zealand Day team introduced the Sponsor Exhibition Area, with space provided as part of each sponsorship package. Some sponsors, however, didn't wish to make use of the space provided. For this year's conference, we've made the exhibition space an optional add-on for some sponsorship levels, so those sponsors can decide whether to have a booth.

|        |Diamond   |Platinum    |Gold    |Silver    |Bronze    |
|-------:|:--------:|:----------:|:------:|:--------:|:--------:|
|**Booth Size**|**30m<sup>2</sup>**|**20m<sup>2</sup>**|**9m<sup>2</sup>**|**6m<sup>2</sup>**|**6m<sup>2</sup>**|
|**Seating**|4 tables<br />8 chairs|3 tables<br />6 chairs|2 tables<br />4 chairs|1 table<br />2 chairs|1 table<br />2 chairs|
|**Rate**|Incl.|$450|$350|$250|$250|

The diagram below depicts the planned arrangement of exhibition spaces in the WG Building Atrium.

![Diagram-Atrium Layout](/assets/images/Exhibition_Area-Cropped2.png)

Unless otherwise requested, each exhibition space will be provided power strips (two (2) each in **Diamond** and **Platinum** spaces, one (1) each in others), and all tables will be fully draped. Booths will be configured by the venue team on Wednesday morning, and will be available for sponsor staff to set up after noon on Wednesday (16 February). If desired, sponsors are welcome to staff their booths on Wednesday afternoon, through the close of pre-conference training (5:30 p.m.).

**Optional Video Displays:** 

**55" Flat-Panel Displays:** The venue's A/V support team can provide 55" HDMI-compatible displays on fixed stands, for use in sponsor exhibition spaces. The cost is $450 each, which includes use of the display during the main conference (Friday and Saturday), delivery/pick-up, and on-site setup. The Diamond sponsor's exhibition space can accommodate up to three (3) displays, Platinum and Gold Sponsor spaces can accommodate two (2) displays, and Silver/Bronze Sponsor spaces can accommodate one (1).

**Video Wall:** There is a permanently installed video wall, located above one end of the Sponsor Exhibition Area. The option is available (on a first-in, first-served basis) for one Gold Sponsor to reserve the booth directly below the video wall and use it during the main conference (Thursday and Friday). The cost for this option is $500.

## COVID-19 Contingencies

Our planning team is operating with the confident outlook that Auckland (and, hopefully, all of New Zealand) will be at Alert Level 1 in February 2022. Despite that confidence, we are making plans to keep things moving if we're wrong.

In the event Auckland is at COVID Alert Level 2 or higher four (4) weeks before the conference (17 January) - or goes into an elevated Alert Level in the weeks preceding the event (18 January - 14 February) - we will postpone to our alternate dates (5-8 July). 

If we are again (or still) at an elevated COVID Alert Level four weeks before our alternate dates (7 June), we will convert the event to either a hybrid (Alert Level 2) or fully online (Alert Level 3 or 4) event. We also intend to follow the example of other recent conferences, and deliver delegate packs (t-shirts, tote bags, promotional materials, etc.) to them via post - to that end, a portion of the catering budget will be redirected to packing and shipping those items.

Given a change in Alert Level can occur with little notice, and owing to the cancellation policies applying to many conference expenses, we anticipate some funds will be 'sunk' in fees for services we're unable to use - possibly including A/V and other charges related to Sponsor Exhibition booths. If we are forced to cancel the in-person event, we'll refund any portion of the Exhibition booth fee and optional A/V charges (see above) we're able to recover, up to 100%.


### Notes

**Training Credits:**

Our pre-conference training is planned to include a mix of half-day, one-day, and two-day classes. Each Premier Sponsor package includes a number of "Training Credits," each valid for one half-day of training for one person. 

  - One credit can be redeemed for a 100% discount on a half-day class, 50% discount on a one-day class, or 25% discount on a two-day class 
  - Credits may be combined - Use two for a 100% discount on a one-day class, or use up to four toward a two-day class
  - To redeem credits, provide the name and email address of each recipient, along with the class in which they'll be registering and the number of credits awarded. The recipient will be issued a single-use discount code, to use in registering for the specified class with the applicable discount.
  - Sponsors are free to allocate training credits as they choose, provided they **are not resold**. If preferred, credits can be turned over to the conference's Diversity Fund committee, for award to applicants.
  
**Free Conference Passes:**

For 2022, we have introduced a $30 per person registration fee for most delegates, while keeping the event FREE for students and unwaged delegates. For registered delegates, conference t-shirts will again be an optional purchase, at $10 each. 

Each sponsorship package includes a number of free conference passes (see table above). Each sponsor delegate will also receive free conference t-shirt.

To claim these free registrations, sponsors must provide the names, email addresses, and t-shirt sizes of those to whom they should be issued, to the conference's Sponsor Liaison. Please plan to provide delegate information on or before Friday, 28 January. Nominees whose information is provided after 28 January cannot be guaranteed a t-shirt in the requested size.

**Sponsor Logos:**

  - Logos are to be provided by the respective sponsors, as digital files in both raster (JPEG, PNG) and vector (SVG) formats
  - Logos provided for inclusion on the website should be full colour
  - For signage and imprinted materials, a single-colour version of the logo should also be
    provided, in a separate file. If a single-colour version of the logo
    is not provided by the sponsor, the conference team
    reserves the right to electronically convert the full-colour logo to
    a single-colour version, or omit the sponsor's logo from signage/imprinted items if that proves infeasible.

**Sponsor Banners:**

  - Lobby and stage-side banners are to be provided by the respective
    sponsors, must be free-standing, and their size is subject to
    approval by the AppSec New Zealand Conference Committee.
  - The conference venue includes two tracks, conducted in separate
    auditoriums, as well as a "mini-track" in the Demo/Breakout Room. 
      - Diamond Sponsors may display one banner to the side of
    each room's stage
      - Platinum Sponsors may display one banner to the side of the stage in the two main track auditoriums 
      - Gold Sponsors may display a banner to the
    side of the stage in one auditorium. Gold Sponsors may express an
    auditorium preference, but final locations are at the discretion of
    the conference team.

**Promotional Items:**

  - Printed materials are limited in dimensions to A4 size - either a
    single sheet, printed on one or both sides; or an A4 booklet
  - Small imprinted items are also acceptable - pens, stress balls, USB
    keys, fidget spinners, etc.
  - Design of printed materials and imprinted items are subject to
    approval by AppSec New Zealand Conference Committee
  - **RECRUITMENT:** In addition to the promotional item allowances
    included in Premium Sponsorship Packages, any sponsor may provide
    one A5-size card with information on *actual current* vacancies for
    which candidates are actively being sought

**All amounts listed are in New Zealand dollars (NZD), and are exclusive of GST.**
