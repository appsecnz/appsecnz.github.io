# Call for Sponsors

## 2024 OWASP New Zealand Day

The 2024 OWASP New Zealand Day conference will be held in Auckland on Thursday and Friday, 5-6 September 2024. This event 
is unique among New Zealand security conferences, in that it's entirely dedicated to application security. AppSec New Zealand Incorporated is, once again, managing the logistics and finances for the event. This year, we have been able to secure a licensing arrangement with the OWASP Foundation, allowing us to return to the event's traditional "OWASP New Zealand Day" branding.

Due to scheduling conflicts at the University of Auckland, we have been unable to secure our usual venue in recent years. For 2022 - 2024, 
our event is hosted at the Auckland University of Technology's city campus, in the Sir Paul Reeves (WG) Building. The shift to our alternative venue has both increased our costs and reduced the event's capacity (assuming from 1,000 to 650.

We strive to keep the costs for delegates low, and provide financial support for students, unwaged, and members of under-represented groups. Thanks to the continuing generosity of our Premier Sponsors, we have been able to consistently deliver an  instructive, high-quality event for the New Zealand community. AppSec New Zealand is strictly not for profit and is a registered New Zealand charity (Charity Number CC59162). Sponsorship funds are used to make the OWASP New Zealand Day conference a compelling and valuable experience for all participants.

Sponsorship funds collected are used for things such as:

* **Venue -** Room use, on-site management, and audio/visual equipment hire and service fees
* **Delegate Badges -** We feel that getting to know people within the New Zealand community is important, and name tags make that possible
* **Promotion -** We would like to reach a wider audience, by utilising paid advertising and online promotion for the event
* **Printed Materials -** Printed materials will include conference programs, badge lanyards, volunteer and delegate t-shirts, and information and room signage
* **Recognition Items -** We love our sponsors, speakers, and trainers, and wish to show them our appreciation with small gifts
* **Catering -** To promote a collegial environment for networking among application security professionals, we're scheduling daily tea breaks and providing coffee/tea service each morning
* **Live Streaming -** Throughout both days of the main conference, we'll be live-streaming all presentations and sessions. Live-stream registration fees only partially offset the costs for on-site audio/visual and live-stream services
* **Administration -** While we do our best to keep day-to-day administrative and operating costs low, we do need to cover ongoing expenses such as insurance, accounting services, and storage fees

Due to continuing increases in service fees and catering charges, the overall budget for this year's conference is approximately 10% larger than for last year's event. As in recent years, the rates for our Premier Sponsorship packages have been increased slightly to help defray these increased costs.

## Facts

The 2020 OWASP New Zealand Day was supported by 13 premier sponsors and attracted more than 800 delegates. For more information on previous OWASP New Zealand Day events, please visit the OWASP New Zealand Chapter's [website](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-new-zealand/). 

Attendance for the first [AppSec New Zealand Conference](/conference-2021), in February 2021, was a bit lower, with approximately 650 delegates attending in person. 2021 also marked our first experience with live-streaming the event, with approximately 300 live-stream registrations. Considering it was our first event under the new name, our first attempt at hosting a two-day conference - *and* the event ended just 30 hours before Auckland's first "snap lockdown" - we consider the event a great success. Those constraints notwithstanding, the AppSec New Zealand Conference was supported by 15 Premier Sponsors, which allowed us to provide travel and training assistance to 33 delegates.

In 2022, we returned to the OWASP New Zealand Day brand. We were able to hold a hybrid conference in July, after many COVID-related restrictions had been relaxed; despite this, in-person attendance (450) was lower than hoped, while we enjoyed a strong online participation through our live-stream offering. The event was supported by 17 sponsors, and our first-ever sponsored LEGO Build was popular with conference attendees.

The activities of AppSec New Zealand, including this conference, are organised to align with and support the educational objectives of the Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) Foundation and its local chapter, OWASP New Zealand ([owasp.org.nz](https://owasp.org.nz)). The OWASP New Zealand community is strong, with more than 500 people currently subscribed to the mailing list 
([sign up](https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-newzealand)). 

Those who regularly attend AppSec conferences include IT project managers, IT security managers,
IT security consultants, software architects and developers, QA
managers, QA testers and system administrators. In addition, approximately one third of conference attendees are 
current students in Computer Science, Information Systems, or Cyber Security programmes.

Throughout its 12 years of operation under the local OWASP chapter, the OWASP New Zealand Day conference attracted more than 90% of its delegates and presenters from within New Zealand. This year, we anticipate pre-registrations for the conference will regain much the ground lost versus pre-COVID numbers, and on-the-day attendance will be 650 or more.

## Premium Sponsorship Packages

### Highlights of Changes for 2024

For 2024, we've made only slight adjustments to our Premier Sponsorship packages:

* In 2022, and even more so in 2023, sponsors were generally not interested in providing give-away items ("SWAG") to be included in the cloth tote bags we distributed to conference attendees. In addition, many attendees were reluctant to keep the bags we provided. For these reasons, we will no longer distribute "SWAG Bags" to conference attendees.
* We've added up-front pricing for sponsors who wish to combine a 'regular' sponsorship package with the LEGO Build Sponsorship. The LEGO Build Sponsorship is still available as a stand-alone sponsorship package, with benefits similar to those at the Silver Sponsor level. However, if you would like to sponsor the LEGO Build *and* have the benefits associated with higher-tier packages (Diamond, Platinum, or Gold), you can pay the **LEGO Build Add-On Fee** (see table below) for both.

Some key elements we added in 2023 will continue in 2024:

* Each Premier Sponsor package includes a number of free conference passes and conference t-shirts ($45 value per person)
* Each Sponsor Exhibition space ("booth") includes a number of Exhibitor Passes, which include tickets for lunch each day ($95 value per person).

### Booking Your Sponsorship

The conference planning team are conscious of many organisations' need for advance planning information. For this reason, we're making this Call for Sponsors available almost a full year before the conference. 

To ensure your place as a Premier Sponsor, you'll want to [get in touch with us](mailto:sponsors@appsec.org.nz) and complete your Sponsorship Agreement as soon as possible.

For Sponsorship Agreements completed *prior to* 1st April 2024, invoices will be issued in April. For Agreements completed *from* 1st April, invoices will be issued upon completing the Agreement. Our payment terms are normally 30 days, but we can accommodate other payment terms by negotiation. 

A sponsor's payment must be *received* before the event begins (i.e., on or before 2nd September) to participate in the event, so invoices issued from 5th August will have shorter payment deadlines.


### LEGO Build and Video Sponsorship

In addition to the tiered sponsorship packages detailed below, we're continuing this exciting *a la carte* opportunity: A LEGO Build Sponsorship! Beginning with the 2022 conference, we've added a Delegate Lounge, adjacent to the Sponsor Exhibition Area. In the Delegate Lounge, conference participants will be able to take part in group builds of several LEGO sets throughout the conference. 

The conference A/V team will capture time-sequenced photos of the build area, and will present a first-cut version of the stop-motion video during the closing session on Friday afternoon. The LEGO Build sponsor will be recognised at the beginning and end of the video, to be published on the OWASP New Zealand Chapter's [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWjcSSETjqhzBlVxXTW1zhg) and promoted through social media.

In addition, all LEGO sets will be awarded to conference delegates during the prize giving at our closing session. The LEGO Build sponsor will be invited to the stage to draw the names of all LEGO prize winners. All LEGO sets *completed* during the conference will be included as part of the top LEGO prize; each incomplete/unopened set will be awarded as a separate prize.

The fee for this one-of-a-kind *a la carte* sponsorship is **$5,500**, to cover the costs of purchasing the LEGO sets and producing the video. Other associated sponsor benefits are similar to those of a **Silver** sponsorship.

### Premier Sponsor Fees and Benefits

All amounts listed are in New Zealand dollars (NZD), and are exclusive of GST.

<sup>&dagger;</sup> A *total* of four (4) exhibition spaces are available for Silver, Bronze, and (non-upgraded) LEGO Build sponsors.

## Exhibition Space

In 2020, the OWASP New Zealand Day team introduced the Sponsor Exhibition Area, with space provided as part of each sponsorship package. Some sponsors, however, didn't wish to make use of the space provided. For this year's conference, we've made the exhibition space an optional add-on for some sponsorship levels, so those sponsors can decide whether to have a booth.

The diagram below depicts the planned arrangement of exhibition spaces in the WG Building Atrium.

![Diagram-Atrium Layout](/assets/images/WG201_Sponsor_Booths.png)

Unless otherwise requested, each exhibition space will be provided power strips (two (2) each in **Diamond** and **Platinum** spaces, one (1) each in others), and all tables will be fully draped. Booths will be configured by the venue team on Wednesday morning, and will be available for sponsor staff to set up after noon on Wednesday (6 July). If desired, sponsors are welcome to staff their booths on Wednesday afternoon, through the close of pre-conference training (5:30 p.m.).

**Optional Video Displays:** 

**55" Flat-Panel Displays:** The venue's A/V support team can provide 55" HDMI-compatible displays on fixed stands, for use in sponsor exhibition spaces. The cost is $550 each, which includes use of the display during the main conference (Friday and Saturday), delivery/pick-up, and on-site setup. The Diamond sponsor's exhibition space can accommodate up to three (3) displays, Platinum Sponsor spaces can accommodate up to two (2) displays, and Gold/Silver/Bronze Sponsor spaces can accommodate one (1).

**Video Wall:** There is a permanently installed video wall, located above one end of the Sponsor Exhibition Area. The option is available (on a first-in, first-served basis) for one sponsor to reserve the video wall and display recorded content throughout the main conference (Thursday and Friday). The cost for this option is $650.

### Notes

**Training Credits:**

Our Pre-Conference Training is planned to include a mix of half-day, one-day, and two-day classes. Each Premier Sponsor package includes a number of "Training Credits," and each credit is valid for one half-day of training for one person. 

  - One credit can be redeemed for a 100% discount on a half-day class, 50% discount on a one-day class, or 25% discount on a two-day class 
  - Credits may be combined - Use two for a 100% discount on a one-day class, or use up to four toward a two-day class
  - To redeem credits, provide the name and email address of each recipient, along with the class in which they'll be registering and the number of credits awarded. The recipient will be issued a single-use discount code, to use in registering for the specified class with the applicable discount.
  - Sponsors are free to allocate training credits as they choose, provided they **are not resold**. If preferred, credits can be turned over to the conference's Diversity Fund committee, for award to applicants.
  
**Free Conference Passes:**

For 2022, we have introduced a $30 per person registration fee for most delegates, while keeping the event FREE for students and unwaged delegates. For registered delegates, conference t-shirts will again be an optional purchase, at $15 each ($12 for students/unwaged). 

Each sponsorship package includes a number of free conference passes (see table above). Each sponsor-supported delegate will also receive free conference t-shirt. Sponsors will be provided a set of single-use Discount Codes, which you are free to use or distribute as you wish, provided they **are not resold**.

**Exhibitor Passes:**

Each sponsor requesting an exhibition space ("booth"), including all **Diamond** and **Platinum** sponsors, will receive a number of passes (see table above) for team members who attend the conference to staff their booth. Each Exhibitor Pass includes free registration for the conference, a conference t-shirt, and lunch vouchers for Thursday and Friday.

Sponsors will be provided a set of single-use Access Codes, each of which will provide access to 'purchase' one (1) "VIP Sponsor" conference registration, at no charge.

**LEGO Build Upgrade:**

If a sponsor wishes to participate as a Diamond, Platinum, or Gold Sponsor, and *also* sponsor the LEGO Build, the listed "LEGO Build Upgrade" fee will be charged, in addition to the base $5,500 LEGO Build Sponsorship fee.

The majority of benefits received will be those listed for the Premier Sponsorship tier. In addition, the sponsor may place up to two (2) company banners in the LEGO Build Area in the Delegate Lounge, will be recognised as both a Premier Sponsor and the LEGO Build Sponsor, and will be featured in the LEGO Build video as described for the LEGO Build Sponsorship.

**Sponsor Logos:**

  - Logos are to be provided by the respective sponsors, as digital files in both raster (JPEG, PNG) and vector (SVG) formats
  - Logos provided for inclusion on the website should be full colour
  - For signage and imprinted materials, a single-colour version of the logo should also be
    provided, in a separate file. If a single-colour version of the logo
    is not provided by the sponsor, the conference team
    reserves the right to electronically convert the full-colour logo to
    a single-colour version, or omit the sponsor's logo from signage/imprinted items if that proves infeasible.

**Sponsor Banners:**

  - Lobby and stage-side banners are to be provided by the respective
    sponsors, must be free-standing, and their size is subject to
    approval by the AppSec New Zealand Conference Committee.
  - The conference venue includes two tracks, conducted in separate
    auditoriums, as well as a "mini-track" in the Demo/Breakout Room. 
      - Diamond Sponsors may display one banner to the side of
    each room's stage (two main tracks, plus Demo/Breakout 'track')
      - Platinum Sponsors may display one banner to the side of the stage in each of the two main track auditoriums 
      - Gold Sponsors may display a banner to the
    side of the stage in one auditorium. Gold Sponsors may express an
    auditorium preference, but final locations are at the discretion of
    the conference team.
      - Any sponsor may display a banner to the side of the main presentation area
      in the Demo/Breakout Room, *while presenting*.

**Company Spotlight**   

  - A "Sponsor Spotlight" is included on the footer of most website pages. 
    One sponsor is selected randomly (on a weighted basis, by sponsor level)
    at page load,
    with a condensed version of the company's description (up to 100 words), 
    the company's logo, and their sponsor level displayed.
  - In addition, up to nine (9) other sponsors' logos are displayed in the
    "Conference Sponsors" section of the footer - also selected on a weighted-random
    basis. 

**All amounts listed are in New Zealand dollars (NZD), and are exclusive of GST.**
