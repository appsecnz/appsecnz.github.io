# Call for Sponsorships

## OWASP New Zealand Day 2020

OWASP New Zealand Day 2020 will be held in Auckland on Friday, 21 February, 2020, and is a security conference entirely dedicated to
application security. he conference is once again being hosted by the University of Auckland with their support and assistance. OWASP New Zealand Day is a very low-cost event, and requires sponsor support to help be an instructive and quality event for the New Zealand community. OWASP is strictly not for profit. The sponsorship money will be used to help make OWASP New Zealand Day 2020 a compelling, and valuable experience for all attendees.

Sponsorship funds collected are to be used for things such as:

* Venue - Room use and on-site management fees
* Name tags - We feel that getting to know people within the New Zealand community is important, and name tags make that possible
* Promotion - We would like to reach a wider audience, by utilising paid advertising for the event
* Printed Materials - Printed materials will include program information, room signs, and lanyards
* Recognition items for speakers and trainers
* Tea breaks , to promote a congenial environment for networking among application security professionals

## Facts

Last year, the event was supported by six premier sponsors and attracted more than 650 attendees. Plenty of constructive (and positive!) feedback from the audience was received, and we are using this to make the conference more appealing to more people. For more information on the last New Zealand Day event, please visit: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_New_Zealand_Day_2019

The OWASP New Zealand community is strong, with more than 500 people currently subscribed to the mailing list 
([sign up](https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-newzealand)). OWASP New Zealand Day is expected to attract between 700 and 850 attendees
this year.

OWASP conferences' regular attendees include IT project managers, IT security managers,
IT security consultants, Web application architects and developers, QA
managers, QA testers and system administrators.
