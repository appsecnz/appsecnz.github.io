## Course Description

Join our intensive, two-day code review training! Tailored for pentesters, appsec engineers and senior developers, this dynamic training delves into the nuances of identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in diverse programming languages, including Java, Ruby, Golang, Python, and PHP.

Our approach is hands-on and case study-driven, utilizing real bugs to illustrate key concepts in each section. By leveraging multiple languages, we aim at providing re-usable patterns as well as covering language specific knowledge and gotchas.

The workshop emphasizes practical skills, ensuring that you leave with not only theoretical knowledge but also the ability to apply these techniques effectively in your code reviews. Perfect for those looking to elevate their code review skills to a professional level, our training offers a unique opportunity to enhance your expertise in a collaborative and dynamic environment.

Attendees will also get to enjoy one-year access to PentesterLab PRO to keep learning after the training.
