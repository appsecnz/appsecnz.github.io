# Diversity and Financial Aid Fund

## OWASP New Zealand Day 2022

Through the generous support of our lovely sponsors, we will have some funding available to help people from around New Zealand attend the OWASP New Zealand Day conference, who would otherwise find it hard to attend. In particular, we welcome applications from women, people of colour, LGBTQ2IA, Pacific Island indigenous peoples, and all others. You all deserve to be able to learn more about security, and we’ll do our best to help make that happen!

For participants from within New Zealand, support provided by the fund can include return airfare to Auckland, an allowance for accommodations in Auckland, and an allowance for taxi/Uber fares to/from the airports.

If funds are available, support may be extended to a limited number of applicants from outside New Zealand (COVID-related travel restrictions permitting). For such applicants, support provided by the fund will be limited to an allowance for accommodations and taxi/Uber fares in Auckland.

Thanks to the generous support of our sponsors, and our training instructors, a limited number of fee waivers/discounts will also be available this year. On the application, you can indicate if you'd like to be considered for a training fee waiver, and provide your class preferences.

Our funds are limited, and we’ll be reviewing applications every week, starting in mid-December. Submit your application soon, so we can approve them promptly, and you’ll be in several review cycles!

Process:

* Fill out our **[Application Form](https://forms.gle/nbdcwzTXmxjCimNq9){: target="_blank" }**
* We will review and approve applications each week. The first reviews will be completed by 8 January.
* We will contact all applicants and let them know the results of the review.
* Successful applicants will be contacted to help sort things out.

We use the following criteria to help us decide who gets approved:

* We are biased towards (but not exclusively for) diverse applicants.
* We do attempt to maximise cost efficiency and will aim to get as many people to the event as possible, with our limited funds.

Applicants' and funding recipients' identities will generally not be disclosed to anyone outside the Diversity Fund committee. If you are a successful applicant, *and* your award was directly supported by a sponsor, you can choose whether to be kept anonymous or to be put in touch with the sponsor supporting your attendance. We think some of our sponsors may enjoy the opportunity to chat with you on the day and talk about your experiences and plans for the future, but that’s totally optional and up to you.

If you have any questions, feel free to [drop us an email](mailto:conference@appsec.org.nz).
