## Course Description

This course teaches the basic techniques for exploiting a vulnerable web application, especially focusing on the OWASP Top 10. Attendee’s will be given targets to exploit along with the tools to do so.

Do terms like XSS, SQLi, RCE, Buffer Overflow, Rootkit, Trojan, Phishing, DDoS, Malware, Virus, or just the word 'Hacker' leave you confused? If so, this training is for you. We all had to start somewhere and this is the training for you, the beginner. Kevin is here to help you enter the world of information security. This will be a 
light-hearted, fun, and interactive session.

We'll talk through what these terms mean and try to answer questions as we go. There'll be live examples of the basics, and an opportunity to try these out in a lab (**so bring along a laptop**). The goal of this session is to come away with some usable knowledge, and an entry-level understanding of the information security world.
