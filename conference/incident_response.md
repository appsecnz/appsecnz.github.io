# Everything is Fine: Making the Most of a Security Incident

## One-Day Interactive (Classroom) Training - AppSec New Zealand Conference 2021

## Abstract

This is a workshop all about security incident response. It will be run in-person by two people who have gone through various different types of incidents and emergencies and have lived to tell the tale.

This course is perfect for those developers, engineers, security professionals, testers, analysts, advisors who might find themselves one day having to get their hands dirty. It will be a focused workshop, using examples, to help you know the hygiene you should follow and actions to take.

## Course Details 

**Dates:** Thursday, 11 February 2021

**Time:** 8:45 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. (NZDT)

**Instructors:** Erica ('sput') Anderson, [SafeStack](https://safestack.io), and Izzi Lithgow

**Course Fee:** NZ $450.00 (plus GST and ticketing fees)

**Registration Site:** [https://events.humanitix.com/appsecnz-training](https://events.humanitix.com/appsecnz-training)

**Attendees Should Bring:** 

Attendees need to come prepared with: 

* Some way to take notes in whatever format suits them - notebooks, laptops, post-it notes. 
* Brain power - so get a good night's sleep, and come prepared for some role playing adventure
* An idea of how they want to apply what they are learning - especially for those of you currently at organisations that have a few things to improve on. Coming to the workshop already knowing how your organisation currently detects and responds to security incidents, which teams or roles are often involved, and how they have survived previous incidents can all help you know where to begin.
  
**Course Outcomes:**

By the end of the day, we are hoping the attendees will leave with: 

* Core knowledge of what is involved in incident response, and how you can apply those concepts to various situations
* A more well-rounded toolkit - including some free resources and external organisations that can help when you aren’t sure what to do
* Confidence of knowing who to talk to (inside and outside the org) and what to do when an incident happens

## Course Outline

During this one-day workshop, we are going to: 

1. Understand what is involved in security incident response, and who is involved
1. Why it is important, and how you can find value even when after having an incident
1. ‘Choose your own [security] adventure’, and a detailed step through a malware and ransomware related incident
1. Storytime with Erica and Izzi, as they explain how to re-apply the concepts from one incident type to others
1. The ‘TL;DR’ version of a choose your own adventure, with a rapid-fire walkthrough of a Denial of Service incidents
