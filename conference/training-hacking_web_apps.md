# Hacking Modern Web Apps: Master the future of attack vectors

## Two-Day Interactive (Classroom) Training - OWASP New Zealand Day 2023

## Abstract

This course is a 100% hands-on deep dive into the OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG) and relevant items of the OWASP Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS). This course covers - and goes beyond - the OWASP Mobile Top Ten.

Long are the days since web servers were run by perl scripts apps written in Delphi. What is common between Walmart, eBay, PayPal, Microsoft, LinkedIn, Google and Netflix? They all use Node.js: JavaScript on the server.

Modern Web apps share traditional attack vectors and also introduce new opportunities to threat actors. This course will teach you how to review modern web apps, showcasing Node.js but using techniques that will also work against any other web app platform. Ideal for Penetration Testers, Web app Developers as well as everybody interested in JavaScript/Node.js and Modern app stack security.

All action, no fluff, improve your security analysis workflow and immediately apply these gained skills in your workplace, packed with exercises, extra-mile challenges and CTF, self-paced and suitable for all skill levels, with continued education via unlimited email support, lifetime access, step-by-step video recordings and interesting apps to practice, including **all future updates** for free.

Get a FREE taste for this training, including access to video recording, slides, and vulnerable apps to play with:

* [One-hour workshop](https://7asecurity.com/free-workshop-web-apps)

#### Key Topics Covered

1. Review of Common Flaws in Source Code and at Runtime
1. Web - Interception of Network Communication and MitM-proxy techniques to find security flaws in these platforms
1. Platform-specific attack vectors against modern Web apps, and their mitigation
1. CTF Challenges for Attendees to Test Their Skills

#### Key Takeaways

* Learn how to find Modern Web App vulnerabilities due to common misconfigurations and typical mistakes in framework setups
* Identify and exploit Modern Web App security vulnerabilities as efficiently as possible
* Improve your Modern Application Security Testing process leveraging a number of open source tools, as well as lots of tips and tricks shared by the instructors after years of Modern Web App penetration testing

## Course Details 

**Dates:** Tuesday and Wednesday, 4-5 July 2022

**Time:** 8:45 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. (NZST)

**Instructor:** Ashwin Shenoi, 7A Security   

**Course Fee:** NZ $1,000.00 (plus GST and ticketing fees)

**Registration Site:** [https://events.humanitix.com/owaspnz2023-training](https://events.humanitix.com/owaspnz2023-training){: target="training-reg" }

**Maximum Enrolment:** 36 attendees

## Prerequisites for This Class

This course has no specific knowledge prerequisites, as it is designed to accommodate students with different skills:

* Advanced students will enjoy comprehensive labs, "extra miles," and CTF Challenges
* Less-experienced students complete what they can during the class, and can continue at their own pace using the training portal

That being said, the more you've learned about the following before the class, the more you will be able to get out of it:

* Linux command-line basics
* Basic knowledge of Node.js and/or JavaScript is not required, but would help

### Hardware and Software: Attendees should bring:

* A laptop with the following specifications:
  * Ability to connect to wireless and wired networks
  * Ability to read PDF files
  * Administrative rights: USB allowed, the ability to deactivate AV, firewall, install tools, etc.
  * Knowledge of the BIOS password, in case VT is disabled.
  * Minimum 8GB RAM (recommended: 16GB+)
  * 60GB+ of free disk space (to copy a lab VM and other goodies)
  * VirtualBox 6.0 or greater, including the “VirtualBox Extension Pack” (**NOTE:** VMware is also known to work)

## Who Should Attend

Any Web App developer, penetration tester or person interested in Modern Web apps, Node.js or JavaScript security will benefit from attending this training regardless of the initial skill level:

The course is for beginners, intermediate, and advanced level students. While beginners are introduced to the nuances of mobile app security from scratch, intermediate and advanced level learners get to perfect both their knowledge and skills on the subject. Extra-mile challenges are available in every module to help more advanced students polish their skills.

The course is crafted in such a way that, regardless of your skill level, you will significantly improve your Web app security auditing skills:

* If you are new and cannot complete the labs during the class, that is OK, as you keep training portal access, you will learn a lot in the class but can continue from home with the training portal.
* If you are more advanced in mobile security you can try to complete the labs in full and then take the CTF Challenges we have for each part, you will likely also attempt to complete some exercises on your own later.

### What to Expect

Lifetime access to training portal (including all future updates), unlimited email support, access to private groups to communicate with other students, interesting apps from various countries.

A fully practical class that will seriously improve your Modern Web App security knowledge and skills, regardless of the skill level you come in with. Battle-tested tips and tricks that take your abilities to the next level and that you can apply as soon as you go back to your workplace, making security testing of Modern Web apps as efficient as possible. Intensive hands-on exercises that challenge you to deep dive into the world of Modern App security.

### What Not to Expect

This is more than your usual short course: You get lifetime access to a training portal with step-by-step video recordings, slides and lab exercises, including all future updates for free.

The course does not cover: 0-days, Windows/Linux/Mac OS exploits, x86 exploit writing, writing buffer or heap overflows.

Do not expect the instructor to be talking through slides most of the time: This class is practical not theoretical, the teachers don’t bore you with slides all the time, instead you do exercises all the time and the teachers help you solve the challenges you face as you complete them.

## Course Objectives
