#### [Secure Code Warrior](https://securecodewarrior.com/){: target="_blank" rel="sponsored"}

![Logo-Secure Code Warrior](/assets/images/Logo-Secure_Code_Warrior.png){: width="300px"}   

Secure Code Warrior was co-founded by Pieter Danhieux and Matias Madou Ph.D., two globally recognised security experts. Through their combined security experience as developers, researchers, trainers and consultants, Pieter and Matias had experienced the negative impact of insecure code and were frustrated by the industry's focus on simply finding vulnerabilities, rather than fixing or preventing them in the first place.

Both recognised that improving secure coding skills and outcomes would add a powerful layer of cyber protection for companies and would help them make better code, faster. Developers didn’t need to become security experts per se, but they could be empowered positively to be the first line of defence for their organisation.

The team pioneered an innovative approach to improving secure coding skills and outcomes that is simple, scalable and positive; and works for both Development and Application or Information Security groups. The team is driven by the knowledge that measurable improvements in security compliance, consistency and predictability will be matched by a better quality and speed of code writing. And that creates an environment in which everyone can enjoy spending more time building, and less time fixing!
