# Options for Lunch

**NEW for 2023:** The conference organising committee is working with the university's catering staff, to make lunch available at the conference venue on all four days of the event. Details are currently TBC, but pre-purchase will be required (as part of your conference and/or training registration).

### If you prefer to find lunch on your own, AUT has many food outlets within a short walking distance.
