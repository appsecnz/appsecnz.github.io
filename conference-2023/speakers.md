*Vandana Verma Sehgal - Chair, OWASP Global Board of Directors*   
Thursday, 10:05   

#### Abstract

The [Open Web Application Security Project](https://owasp.org){: target="_blank" } (OWASP) has profoundly influenced the cybersecurity arena since its inception in 2001, primarily focusing on web application security. This talk outlines the evolution of OWASP, beginning with its establishment and early development of the influential [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/Top10/){: target="_blank" } - a document identifying the most prevalent security risks to web applications. We then shift to a discussion of the present day, where OWASP has grown into a global entity, offering a variety of tools, documentation, and community resources that contribute significantly to cybersecurity best practices. 

Finally, we delve into the future of OWASP, conjecturing its direction based on emerging trends in web applications and cybersecurity. This includes speculation on how OWASP will continue adapting to the evolving threat landscape and the growing complexity of web applications. Through this exploration, we illustrate how OWASP's journey reflects the evolution of web application security itself and its increasing relevance in a digitally interconnected world.
