# Hacking iOS and IoT Apps by Example

## One-Day Interactive (Classroom) Training - OWASP New Zealand Day 2023

## Abstract

This course is a 100% hands-on deep dive into the OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG) and relevant items of the OWASP Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS). This course covers - and goes beyond - the OWASP Mobile Top Ten.

Learn about iOS and IoT app security, by improving your mobile security testing Kung-Fu. Ideal for Penetration Testers, Mobile Developers, and everybody interested in mobile app security.

All action, no fluff, improve your security analysis workflow and immediately apply these gained skills in your workplace, packed with exercises, extra-mile challenges and CTF, self-paced and suitable for all skill levels, with continued education via unlimited email support, lifetime access, step-by-step video recordings and interesting apps to practice, including **all future updates** for free.

Get a FREE taste for this training, including access to video recording, slides, and vulnerable apps to play with:

* [Teaser Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re5oqfVkgd4)
* [Four-hour workshop](https://7asecurity.com/free-workshop-mobile-practical)

#### Key Topics Covered

1. Review of Common Flaws in Source Code and at Runtime
1. Modification of App Behavior Through Code/Configuration Changes
1. Interception of Network Communication (a/k/a MitM)
1. Jailbreak/Root Detection Bypasses and App Review from a Privileged Standpoint
1. Instrumentation (Review and Modification of App Behavior)
1. CTF Challenges for Attendees to Test Their Skills

#### Key Takeaways

* Learn how to find IoT vulnerabilities without even access to the physical device via mobile app analysis only.
* Identify and exploit mobile app security vulnerabilities as efficiently as possible
* Improve your mobile security testing process leveraging a number of open source tools, as well as lots of tips and tricks shared by the instructors after years of mobile app penetration testing.

## Course Details 

**Dates:** Wednesday, 5 July 2022

**Time:** 8:45 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. (NZST)

**Instructor:** Abhishek J.M., 7A Security   

**Course Fee:** NZ $500.00 (plus GST and ticketing fees)

**Registration Site:** [https://events.humanitix.com/owaspnz2023-training](https://events.humanitix.com/owaspnz2023-training){: target="training-reg" }

**Maximum Enrolment:** 36 attendees

## Prerequisites for This Class

This course has no specific knowledge prerequisites, as it is designed to accommodate students with different skills:

* Advanced students will enjoy comprehensive labs, "extra miles," and CTF Challenges
* Less-experienced students complete what they can during the class, and can continue at their own pace using the training portal

That being said, the more you've learned about the following before the class, the more you will be able to get out of it:

* Linux command-line basics
* iOS basics

### Hardware and Software: Attendees should bring:

* A laptop with the following specifications:
  * Ability to connect to wireless and wired networks
  * Ability to read PDF files
  * Administrative rights: USB allowed, the ability to deactivate AV, firewall, install tools, etc.
  * Knowledge of the BIOS password, in case VT is disabled.
  * Minimum 8GB RAM (recommended: 16GB+)
  * 60GB+ of free disk space (to copy a lab VM and other goodies)
  * VirtualBox 6.0 or greater, including the “VirtualBox Extension Pack”
  * Genymotion (can be the free version)
* A mobile phone capable of receiving text messages
* **A jailbroken iPhone / iDevice with iOS >=9 (ideally: iOS 12-14), for the iOS labs**
* *Optional, but useful* - One of the following: BurpSuite, ZAP or Fiddler (for MitM)
* *Optional, but useful:* A Mac/Hackintosh with the latest XCode installed, for iOS code review & labs

## Who Should Attend

Any mobile developer, penetration tester or person interested in mobile security will benefit from attending this training regardless of the initial skill level.

The course is for beginners, intermediate, and advanced level students. While beginners are introduced to the nuances of mobile app security from scratch, intermediate and advanced level learners get to perfect both their knowledge and skills on the subject. Extra-mile challenges are available in every module to help more advanced students polish their skills.

The course is crafted in such a way that, regardless of your skill level, you will significantly improve your mobile security skills:

* If you are new and cannot complete the labs during the class, that is OK, as you keep training portal access, you will learn a lot in the class but can continue from home with the training portal.
* If you are more advanced in mobile security you can try to complete the labs in full and then take the CTF Challenges we have for each part, you will likely also attempt to complete some exercises on your own later.

### What to Expect

A fully practical class that will seriously improve your mobile security knowledge and skills, regardless of the skill level you come in with.

Battle-tested tips and tricks that take your abilities to the next level and that you can apply as soon as you go back to your workplace, making security testing of mobile apps as efficient as possible.

Intensive hands-on exercises that challenge you to deep dive into the world of mobile security.

Lifetime access to training portal (including all future updates), unlimited email support, access to private groups to communicate with other students, mandated, police, IoT and otherwise interesting apps from various countries.

### What Not to Expect

This is more than your usual short course: You get lifetime access to a training portal with step-by-step video recordings, slides and lab exercises, including all future updates for free.

The course does not cover: iOS 0-day, exploits against the platforms themselves, ARM exploit writing, writing buffer or heap overflows.

Do not expect the teachers to be talking through slides most of the time: This class is practical not theoretical, the teachers don’t bore you with slides all the time, instead you do exercises all the time and the teachers help you solve the challenges you face as you complete them.

## Course Objectives
