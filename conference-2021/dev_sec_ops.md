# DevSecOps: Automating Security in DevOps

## Two-Day Interactive (Live Online) Training - AppSec New Zealand Conference 2021

## Abstract

Two Days hands-on training to automate security into a fast-paced DevOps environment, using various open-source tools and scripts.

Key Takeaways:

* Understand how to tackle security issues in a fast-moving DevOps environment
* Identify tools/solutions and develop processes to create a secure by default infrastructure
* In-depth understanding of various tools that can be used for security automation
* Utilize the integration scripts and tools provided in the DevSecOps Lab to create your own DevSecOps pipeline

## Course Details 

**Dates:** Wednesday and Thursday, 10-11 February 2021

**Time:** 8:45 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. (NZDT), each day

**Instructor:** Rohit Salecha, [NotSoSecure](https://notsosecure.com)   

**Course Fee:** NZ $900.00 (plus GST and ticketing fees)

**Registration Site:** [https://events.humanitix.com/appsecnz-training](https://events.humanitix.com/appsecnz-training)

**Minimum Enrolment:** Ten (10) paid registrations

**Prerequisite Skills:**

Anybody with a background in IT or related to software development whether a developer or a manager can attend this course to get an insight about DevOps and DevSecOps.

**Attendees Should Have:** 

* Any computer with an updated browser
* In order to access our labs, you’ll need an unfiltered direct connection to the Internet. Our labs will not be accessible from behind a proxy or a firewalled Internet connection.

**Attendees Will Receive:**

* Access to cloud **DevSecOps Lab** during the class, and for 24 hours post-training for further hands-on practice
* A **DevSecOps Lab** VM (designed by the NotSoSecure team) containing all the code, scripts and tools used to build the entire DevSecOps pipeline

## Course Overview

Modern enterprises are implementing the technical and cultural changes required to embrace DevOps methodology, by introducing practices such Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Delivery (CD), Continuous Monitoring (CM) and Infrastructure as Code(IaC). DevSecOps extends DevOps, by introducing security in each of these practices, giving a certain level of security assurance in the final product. In this training, we will demonstrate using our state-of-the-art **DevSecOps Lab** as to how to inject security in CI, CD, CM and IaC.

Every attendee will be provided a personalized cloud setup of our **DevSecOps Lab** for hands-on implementation of various security tools in the CI/CD/CM pipeline. As a take-away, attendees will receive the complete **DevSecOps Lab**, built using Vagrant and Ansible and comprising the same tools and scripts as those used in class.
