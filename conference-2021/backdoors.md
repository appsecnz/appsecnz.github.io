# Using *Backdoors & Breaches* to Run Incident Response Table-Top Exercises

## Half-Day Interactive (Classroom) Training - AppSec New Zealand Conference 2021

## Abstract

Have you ever wanted to conduct an incident response tabletop exercise but didn't know how to get started or what even to talk about? The team at Black Hills Information Security (BHIS) created a card game that is like Dungeons & Dragons meets Incident Response, called *Backdoors & Breaches*. Jason Blanchard is the co-creator of the game and will conduct a live (he will be remote with local support in the classroom) training session on how to use the cards to help you and your team prepare for the possible attacks your organization can face and how you can address those issues ahead of time. It will be fun, engaging, and educational... just like how a tabletop exercise should be.
