# AppSec New Zealand Incorporated

## Who Are We?

AppSec New Zealand Incorporated (AppSec NZ) is an all-volunteer, non-profit Incorporated Society and NZ-registered charity (Charity Number CC59162), whose primary purposes are to:

* organise and conduct application security conferences, training, and other educational events; and
* provide financial and other support for educational activities which advance awareness of, understanding of, and opportunities in application security.

## What Do We Do?

Our primary activity is organising and conducting the annual [OWASP New Zealand Day](conference/index.md) conference in Auckland. The conference is organised in collaboration with the OWASP New Zealand Chapter, and the OWASP name and branding are used under license from the [OWASP Foundation](https://owasp.org).

In addition to the annual conference, AppSec NZ supports:

* annual [security.ac.nz](https://security.ac.nz) conferences, at universities in Auckland and Wellington; 
* occasional Training Day events, organised in collaboration with the OWASP New Zealand Chapter; and
* other AppSec-related education and outreach activities, as resources and volunteer time permit.
