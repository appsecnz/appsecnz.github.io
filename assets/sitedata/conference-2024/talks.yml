    This talk will feature the OWASP Top 10 for APIs, OWASP Security Culture, and share Amazon's own learnings 
    from moving to a decentralised security culture that allows security to remain our top priority while 
    allowing our product teams to move fast.
  description: |-
    APIs are the essential component of modern security. They are both a fundamental building block, the 
    increasing focus of attackers, and a mental model for transforming the way you approach security. 
    Traditionally, technologist use APIs for machine to machine communication, but APIs can also be used 
    to define structured interfaces for human to human interactions. Redefine your security strategy as 
    an API interface to reduce friction, improve transparency and inspect decision making at scale. 
    This session will briefly describe what APIs are and how to work with them securely, and will then 
    show you how to transform your organisation’s security strategy by using APIs as mechanisms to trust but verify technology teams as they move fast and stay secure.

    Computers like to request things from each other all the time. What happens if you convince a 
    computer to make a request on your behalf? Enter SSRF (Server Side Request Forgery), a versatile 
    vulnerability with a range of delightful outcomes.
  description: |-
    SSRF (Server Side Request Forgery) is a way of coercing a server into making a request on behalf 
    of a user. Sounds like it could be intended functionality, right? Quite often this can be leveraged 
    into something much much worse, including using this bug class to pivot further into cloud environments, 
    access internal resources and configuration files, to name a few. This talk is a deep dive into SSRF
    as a bug and some of the more unexpected and lesser known outcomes from exploiting this vulnerability.

    The serverless environment abstracts the underlying infrastructure, enabling developers to 
    build and run applications without worrying about server provisioning, scaling, or maintenance. 
    The application development involves event-driven architecture, where functions are triggered 
    by specific events and the resources are scaled on demand. Overall, the environment offers a 
    flexible, agile and cost-effective approach to deploying and running applications, allowing 
    organisations to focus on application development and innovation. The dynamic nature of

  name: David MacDonald
  org: Amazon Web Services
  anchor: macdonald-strategies
  abstract: |-
    Bots, both good and bad, crawling your platform are common when delivering a web presence. 
    Bad bots crawling your application consume valuable resources, impact user experience and 
    exploit processes intended for humans. In this talk I walk you through strategies for managing 
    bots both good and bad.
  description: |-
    Bots, or scripts that crawl your website are an everyday occurrence for anyone operating a web 
    application on the Internet. ‘Good bots’ such as Googlebot are such because they help attract 
    customers to your website through SEO while being respectful in how they crawl your website. 
    Poorly behaved ‘bad’ bots on the other hand can impact the experience of your legitimate users 
    through overloading your website or driving increased infrastructure costs for your business. 
    Malicious bots take this further by exploiting processes intended for humans including snapping up 
    limited concert tickets, and taking over user accounts via leaked credentials.
    </p><p>
    In this talk I walk you through strategies for managing bot traffic, both good, bad, and malicious. 
    Through starting simple I will walk you through the basics of identifying and mitigating easily 
    identifiable bot traffic using straight forward traffic signatures. I then dive deeper on 
    sophisticated bot identification mechanisms including how client-side Javascript code, and 
    Machine Learning can be used to detect sophisticated distributed bot nets potentially running 
    across 10s of thousands of hosts. 
    </p><p>
    Managing bots is a constant battle between the sophistication of your  mitigations and the effort 
    an adversary puts into circumventing these mitigations; all while ensuring your legitimate 
    customers aren’t adversely impacted. This is especially true when your web presence has a 
    material financial reward for an adversary through exploiting fraudulent logins using stolen 
    credentials, generating fake registrations for sign-up bonuses, or purchasing all the tickets 
    to your favourite concert. I introduce techniques for adjusting your user experience to mitigate 
    the risk of negatively impacting legitimate customers while minimising fraudulent transactions 
    from sophisticated bots.
    </p><p>
    You will walk away from this talk with an understanding of how to implement effective bot control 
    mechanisms that let good bots through while controlling the impact of bad and malicious bots 
    without negatively impacting your legitimate users.

  org: PrivSec Consulting
  anchor: jakowetz-keeping
  abstract: |-
    Anyone who stores, process or transmits credit card data must meet the Payment Card Industry Data Security
    Standard (PCI DSS). But what does that actually mean, and what do you have to do? 
    This talk will run through the requirements of the PCI standard from a developer perspective.
  description: |-
    Do you take credit card payments? This might be via your call centre, website, payment terminals or mobile app. 
    If you store, process or transmit cardholder data, you have a requirement to meet the Payment Card Industry 
    Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). 
    </p><p>
    The standard is comprehensive, and lays down the minimum security controls that must be in place. Even if 
    you are redirecting to a 3rd party payment provider, such as WindCave, you still have responsibilities in 
    regards to the security of credit card data. 
    </p><p>
    While there are a lot of considerations when meeting the standard, there are regular requirements that 
    you must consider, including the completion of regular penetration tests. 
    </p><p>
    This talk discusses the following:
    <ul>
    <li> Summary of what’s in the PCI-DSS</li>
    <li> Summary of why it’s important, and that it is really just a minimum standard for good practice</li>
    <li> How it compares to other standards</li>
    <li> What's new in v4 of the standard</li>
    <li> What the different acronyms mean (SAQ, AOC, ROC etc)</li>
    <li> What are the key things for developers to consider</li>
    <li> What testing can developers do to make this work for them</li>
    <li> What can be automated by developers to make this work for them</li>
    <li> What you have to do on a regular basis</li>
    <li> How do you benefit by meeting the standard</li>

    A whirlwind tour of the current state of SLSA, and how you can (try to) apply it and related tools and systems
    to your own continuous integration setup, to achieve verifiably secured build processes that you and 
    your users can depend on.
  description: |-
    Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA—pronounced "salsa") is a new-ish and rising framework 
    from the Open Source Security Foundation around software supply-chain security, intended to guide anyone 
    who produces software artifacts intended for consumption by others.  With a strong focus on automated build 
    systems, SLSA both aims to assist those producers to ensure that their products are guarded against the 
    possibility of security issues from breaches in the software supply-chain (or becoming the breach), and to 
    enable consumers of those products to verify the producers' security claims.  This talk aims to introduce 
    experienced software developers to the overarching ideas of SLSA, and demonstrate how they can incorporate 
    some of its guidance into their own CI systems to achieve greater security.

    InfosecNZ Discord, occasionally giving security talks, collaborating with the security team at work, 
    and not shutting up about AppSec around his colleagues.  He read the SLSA website in its entirety in

  title: Jailbreaking and Securing LLM Apps: Lessons from an online wargame experiment
  name: Pedram Hayati
  org: SecDim
  anchor: hayati-lessons
  abstract: |-
    This presentation captures findings from a AI wargame designed to evaluate the resilience of LLMs 
    against prompt injection attacks. The experiment involved an Attack & Defence wargame where 
    participants were tasked with securing their apps while attacking other LLM apps.
  description: |-
    LLMs currently struggle to consistently adhere to instructions in the presence of prompt injections. 
    This poses a significant challenge to their utilisation in various applications. To assess the 
    efficacy of defensive measures for AI applications against prompt injections, we conducted a novel online experiment..
    </p><p>
    We created an online wargame where participants were tasked with safeguarding their AI applications 
    from revealing their secret phrases while simultaneously attempting to compromise other players' apps 
    to extract theirs. In the event of a successful exfiltration of a secret phrase, the compromised app 
    was removed from the game. The player then had an opportunity to enhance the security of their AI 
    app and rejoin the competition.
    </p><p>
    Our experiment revealed that every app was exploited, indicating how the defensive strategies employed 
    to protect the apps exhibited vulnerabilities. This supports our hypothesis that constructing a secure 
    LLM app remains an ongoing challenge, partly due to a limited understanding of the underlying prompt 
    injection mechanism.
    </p><p>
    This presentation presents the outcomes of our online attack and defence wargame and highlights the 
    inherent challenges associated with securing LLM based apps.

  anchor: gray-securely
  abstract: |-
    Some 50 years after the first email message was sent, email continues to be an important channel 
    for organisations to reach their users. In this talk SMX will present best practices for sending 
    and securing email, to ensure optimal delivery rates while protecting your users, your brand, 
    and your reputation. This will focus on use of email authentication mechanisms including DMARC, 
    DKIM, and SPF, and how best to configure them.
  description: |-
    The talk will describe the basic mechanisms by which email messages are delivered over the internet, 
    including Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs) and the SMTP protocol. We will discuss the security 
    limitations of early email, and how it has evolved and extended over time to address these 
    limitations. We will discuss the DMARC, DKIM, and SPF protocols, the benefits and limitations 
    of each, how they interact, how to configure them, and some of the challenges you may face. 
    Based on our experiences hosting and securing email for a variety of New Zealand organisations, 
    we will present examples of email abuse that could have been prevented with effective 
    authentication in place. Finally, we will present a view of the NZ email security landscape 
    based on recent data.

  description: |-
    Are you a developer eager to improve the security of your application and protect your users' 
    accounts as best as you can? Join us for an educational talk focusing on authentication - a 
    crucial component of every application.
    </p><p>
    In our penetration tests, we frequently come across the same authentication flows. These 
    include non-existent or insufficient brute-force protection, user account enumeration, 
    insecure password change and recovery mechanisms, and weaknesses in two-factor 
    authentication and password management.
    </p><p>
    We’ll dive deep into each of these flaws and refer to the OWASP Application Security 
    Verification Standard for essential security controls that should be implemented by 
    every application. You'll learn simple, tool-free methods (where possible) as well 
    as a bit more advanced techniques using Burp as a proxy to intercept, manipulate, 
    and automate requests to identify these vulnerabilities.
    </p><p>
    To help you fix these weaknesses, we'll turn to the OWASP Cheat Sheet Series, providing 
    you with practical, actionable solutions. You'll learn how to properly remedy these security 
    risks without introducing new vulnerabilities.
    </p><p>
    This talk will empower you to find and fix the most common authentication flaws yourself, 
    equipping you with the knowledge and skills to make your applications more secure.
