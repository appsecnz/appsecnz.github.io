# Definitions for this file - The design of the HTML-generation implementation is intended
#   to support any number of days, time blocks, and technical tracks.
# The current assumption is that there is one additional 'track,' supporting events and
#   presentations that don't fit into the standard track-based format.
# selected: true, if the Programme Committee has accepted the talk; false, if not
# confirmed: true, if the speaker has confirmed their participation; false, if not
# day: 0 - First day of conference; 1 - Second day of conference; etc.
# plenary: true, if the entry's content should span all track columns in the schedule grid.
#   - To work correctly, there should be only one entry in the time block, and it must be placed in Track '0'
#   - For content, use 'title,' 'name,' and 'org' properties - Content of 'title' (currently) renders
#     on first line, in Bold; 'name' and 'org' display on second line in Italics (with '-' as separator, if both provided)
# info: true, if the entry is 'informational' in nature (e.g., tea break, lunch)
#   - These render with a different background colour
#   - Currently ignored, unless 'plenary' is also set to true
# block: Block number of the speaker's time slot - First block of the day is Block 0
# track: Track number (0 - Track One; 1 - Track Two)
#   - Demo/Breakout ("Track 3") info goes in breakouts.yml

  title: Helping Elderly Activists Improve Their Security
  name: Kris Hardy
  org: Plexure
  anchor: hardy-helping
  abstract: |-
    Many infosec problems that are solved for the enterprise are unsolved for individuals and at-risk groups due to cost, 
    needed infrastructure, or high risk. Based on my volunteer work with activists, the elderly, etc, 
    I will present lessons learned and a risk framework for working with these groups.
  description: |-
    For many of us in the infosec industry, we are focused on the security of our employers, our customers, 
    and our fellow co-workers. However, many problems that are solved for the enterprise are unattainable for
    individuals and at-risk groups due to cost, needed infrastructure or personnel, or increased risk posed to the 
    individual. In my volunteer work with peace activists, the elderly, and families with vulnerable youth, 
    I've seen both successful and failed approaches to helping them improve their security. I will talk about 
    some lessons learned, and present the risk framework I've developed for thinking through security improvements 
    with these groups, and in turn, provide some insight on how we can improve security collaboration within our 
    enterprises.
  bio: |-
    I'm a US Air Force veteran, US Air Force Academy Graduate, and have a strange career path: Programmer, biochemist, 
    propellant/nerve agent/coatings chemist, embedded/sw/security engineer. I've taught IT and infosec courses for 
    Central New Mexico Community College. I've started companies in my past, but no real wins yet. 
    I was the organizer of DC505 and ABQpy, and am a member of Veterans For Peace.

  title: Keeping the Bank Happy: PCI DSS v4
  name: Peter Jakowetz
  org: PrivSec Consulting
  anchor: jakowetz-keeping
  abstract: |-
    Anyone who stores, process or transmits credit card data must meet the Payment Card Industry Data Security
    Standard (PCI DSS). But what does that actually mean, and what do you have to do? 
    This talk will run through the requirements of the PCI standard from a developer perspective.
  description: |-
    Do you take credit card payments? This might be via your call centre, website, payment terminals or mobile app. 
    If you store, process or transmit cardholder data, you have a requirement to meet the Payment Card Industry 
    Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). 
    </p><p>
    The standard is comprehensive, and lays down the minimum security controls that must be in place. Even if 
    you are redirecting to a 3rd party payment provider, such as WindCave, you still have responsibilities in 
    regards to the security of credit card data. 
    </p><p>
    While there are a lot of considerations when meeting the standard, there are regular requirements that 
    you must consider, including the completion of regular penetration tests. 
    </p><p>
    This talk discusses the following:
    <ul>
    <li> Summary of what’s in the PCI-DSS</li>
    <li> Summary of why it’s important, and that it is really just a minimum standard for good practice</li>
    <li> How it compares to other standards</li>
    <li> What's new in v4 of the standard</li>
    <li> What the different acronyms mean (SAQ, AOC, ROC etc)</li>
    <li> What are the key things for developers to consider</li>
    <li> What testing can developers do to make this work for them</li>
    <li> What can be automated by developers to make this work for them</li>
    <li> What you have to do on a regular basis</li>
    <li> How do you benefit by meeting the standard</li>
    </ul>

  title: "Harnessing Generative AI: Security strategies for next-gen applications"
  name: Ratan Kumar
  org: Amazon Web Services
  anchor: kumar-harnessing
  abstract: |-
    Generative AI has captured the imagination of every enterprise. In this session, we'll discuss the strategies 
    for scoping the security risks for different Gen AI workloads and the approach for establishing an 
    enterprise-ready Generative AI platform to consistently mitigate those risks.
  description: |-
    Generative AI, fuelled by large language models and transformer neural networks, is transforming industries 
    worldwide, enhancing customer experiences, and unlocking unprecedented productivity and creativity. 
    The integration of Generative AI into core business practices necessitates even greater focus on security 
    to ensure it is employed responsibly and effectively. In this presentation, we’ll discuss the rapidly evolving 
    landscape of Generative AI and the associated security and privacy implications. We will discuss the strategy to 
    classify Generative AI use-cases and scope the risks for different types of workloads. 
    We’ll share practical insights and best practices for addressing the risks and how you can establish an 
    enterprise ready Generative AI platform to safely transition from prototyping to production. 
    You’ll leave the session with the knowledge and strategies needed to accelerate your generative 
    AI journey in a safe and responsible way.
