# Definitions for this file - The design of the HTML-generation implementation is intended
#   to support any number of days, time blocks, and technical tracks.
# The current assumption is that there is one additional 'track,' supporting events and
#   presentations that don't fit into the standard track-based format.
# selected: true, if the Programme Committee has accepted the talk; false, if not
# confirmed: true, if the speaker has confirmed their participation; false, if not
# day: 0 - First day of conference; 1 - Second day of conference; etc.
# plenary: true, if the entry's content should span all track columns in the schedule grid.
#   - To work correctly, there should be only one entry in the time block, and it must be placed in Track '0'
#   - For content, use 'title,' 'name,' and 'org' properties - Content of 'title' (currently) renders
#     on first line, in Bold; 'name' and 'org' display on second line in Italics (with '-' as separator, if both provided)
# info: true, if the entry is 'informational' in nature (e.g., tea break, lunch) 
#   - These render with a different background colour
#   - Currently ignored, unless 'plenary' is also set to true 
# block: Block number of the speaker's time slot - First block of the day is Block 0
# track: Track number (0 - Track One; 1 - Track Two)
#   - Demo/Breakout ("Track 3") info goes in breakouts.yml
# name: Speaker's name
# title: Full title of talk
# anchor: Whitespace-free ID/tag value for the talk
#   - Ignored, if 'plenary' is true
# org: Speaker's organisation
# remote: true, if speaker is presenting remotely; false, if not
# video: URL of video, once uploaded to YouTube
# length: Runtime of YouTube video
# slides: full path to presentation slide deck, if in local assets; full URL, if not
# format: File format for slide deck
# size: File size of slide deck
# abstract: short description of the talk
# description: full-length description of the talk
# bio: brief biography provided by the speaker 
# twitter: speaker's Twitter handle (without the '@')
# NOTE: For multiple speakers, use 'name2'/'org2'/'bio2'/'twitter2'/'linkedin2' first, then 'name3'/'org3'/etc. 
#   - Automation currently supports up to 3 speakers per talk
