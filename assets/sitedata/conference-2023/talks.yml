  abstract: |-
    I will present how an organization can approach the visibility, and thus the security, <strong>OF</strong> their CI/CD ecosystem, 
    some common attack areas - access controls, credentials hygiene, misconfiguration, etc. - and possible solutions. 
    I will introduce CICDGuard, a graph-based CI/CD ecosystem visualizer and security analyzer.
  description: |-
    CI/CD platforms are an integral part of the overall software supply chain and it processes a lot of sensitive data, 
    compromise of which can affect the entire organization. Security <strong>IN</strong> CI/CD is a well-discussed topic; 
    security <strong>OF</strong> CI/CD deserves the same attention.
    </p>
    <p>
    One of the challenges with security of CI/CD, like most areas of security, is the lack of visibility regarding what 
    actually makes up the CI/CD ecosystem. Security starts with being aware of what needs to be secure.
    </p>
    <p>
    In this talk, I will be presenting how an organization can approach the visibility, and thus the security 
    <strong>OF</strong> their CI/CD ecosystem, along with some common attack areas like access controls, credentials hygiene, 
    misconfiguration, etc., and their possible solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
    I will introduce CICDGuard - a graph-based CI/CD ecosystem visualizer and security analyzer, which:

  title: 'MPT: Pentest in Action'
  name: Jyoti Raval
  org: Harness
  anchor: raval-pentest-in-action 
  abstract: |-
    In ever evolving software development world, security is also becoming fast paced. Hence, each product going through the  
    pentest cycle has to be managed effectively and efficiently. Managing multiple pentests and testers is important. 
    A single pane of glass view for all of these with risk posture is helpful.
  description: |-
    Security penetration testing is becoming as necessary and as usual a practice as software testing. Most, if not all, 
    organisations either have their own penetration testing team or they utilise third-party pentesters.
    </p>
    <p>
    Imagine any fast-paced organisation developing multiple product lines and planning to release each of them from time 
    to time. It becomes challenging for the organisation's security team to efficiently manage all of these pentest activities 
    running and effectively produce security assessment reports and track them.
    </p>
    <p>
    Because of such volume of work, the numbers of pentesters in organisations are increasing to keep up. Each pentester 
    is doing multiple pentests. The next cycle of a previous pentest can get assigned to another pentester. Each pentesting 
    cycle has issues and recurring issues. And above all, managing all these using Excel worksheets is nightmare.
    </p>
    <p>
    A pentesting activity knowledge base is kind of must. A single-pane-of-glass view to all pentests running, and the issues 
    identified, is a necessity for everyone involved in the security review cycle.
    </p>
    <p>
    To solve these challenges, I have developed a solution called <strong>Managing Pentest (MPT): Pentest in Action</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
    MPT helps us solve various problems:
    <ul>
    <li>Asset DB to know all organisation assets that are in pentest process. You can’t secure what you are not aware of!</li>
    <li>Tracking each pentest</li>
    <li>Pentesting activity knowledge which comprises of what particular let say application does, or the purpose of 
    hardware that we are testing</li>
    <li>When the next pentester takes over the testing all they have to do is view the asset and associated information, 
    which is already there</li>
    <li>Time taken for each pentest</li>
    <li>Real time tracking of activity</li>
    <li>Issue status</li>
    <li>Common issues that are observed</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    Why MPT? MPT also provides security pentest analytics, which helps us not only track and view everything in 
    single pane of glass but also:
    <ul>
    <li>Finding improvement areas to boost pen tester productivity</li>
    <li>Understand the current risk posture</li>
    <li>Understand recurring issues</li>
    <li>Average amount of time taken for each pentest vs. asset size</li>
    <li>Average high/medium/low fixing time</li>
    <li>Most num of vulnerabilities fixed in a year</li>
    <li>Class of new vulnerabilities coming</li>
    <li>Developer trends</li>
    <li>Open findings</li>
    <li>Critical assessments</li>
    <li>Asset health</li>
    <li>Top pentester reported findings</li>
    <li>Average busy time for each pentester</li>
    </ul>

  title: Securing REST API Endpoints (or, How to avoid another Optus)
  name: James Cooper
  anchor: cooper-securing-api-endpoints
  abstract: |-
    Optus and their customers had a very bad time in 2022, with a massive data breach resulting in PII and ID 
    documents released into the wild. This happened because a REST API was not properly secured. We’ll talk about the 
    practical steps you can take to prevent this from happening to you.
  description: |-
    In September 2022, the major Australian telco Optus suffered a significant data breach. Initial reports suggested 
    records for as many as 10 million customers (more than one-third of Australia’s total population) leaked. In the end, 
    Optus got lucky, and the so-called hacker only leaked 10,000 records before getting spooked by the intense focus on the 
    incident and abandoning their attempts to monetise the data. Nevertheless, the risk of the rest being leaked remained, 
    forcing a massive effort from ID issuers to reissue passports, driver's licences, and other PII documents.
    </p>
    <p>
    This was not just another typical data breach that was forgotten in a week - it had a broad impact in Australia and 
    suddenly shifted thinking in other organisations. The whole affair was undoubtedly costly to Optus, both financially 
    and reputationally. The most embarrassing part, though, is that the data were supposedly scraped from an API endpoint 
    that should have been secured but wasn't. This talk will briefly speculate on why that might have been, and then 
    describe various high-level technical and cultural approaches you can use to guard against something like this 
    happening to your organisation.
    </p>
    <p>
    The purpose of this talk is <strong>NOT</strong> to embarrass Optus or its staff. Rather, the point is for all of 
    us to learn what went wrong and (more importantly) do our best to avoid repeating the same mistake(s). This talk is 
    aimed primarily at Web developers relatively new to thinking about security - especially those working on REST 
    APIs - and managers keen to help their team avoid making similar mistakes. There should be something for just 
    about everyone interested in web application security, however.

  abstract: |-
    BOTs have evolved to become one of the hardest problems to solve in security. I will highlight use-cases for 
    automation, against some well known e-commerce platforms, and demonstrate the real-world tools used by threat 
    actors today to conduct account takeover and fraud.
  description: |-
    Every application on the Internet has an automation problem - only the difference is the level of sophistication 
    of the automated threat. Whether it's something as simple as a vulnerability scanner or a more sophisticated bad 
    actor crafting a tool to target your application, organisations are forced to put some security controls in place 
    to mitigate the threat and reduce the risk of fraud and account takeover.
    </p>
    <p>
    As BOTs have become more sophisticated it is harder to distinguish between traffic from a real human and traffic 
    from automation crafted by a skilful bad actor. The result is often that websites will resort to crude measures 
    like CAPTCHA to attempt to prove someone is human - something that bad actors can easily bypass and resulting 
    in a terrible user experience for everyone else.
    </p>
    <p>
    This talk will walk through the timeline of how BOTs have evolved to become one of the hardest problems to 
    solve in security. Mapping to the OWASP Automated Threat handbook, I will highlight use-cases for automation 
    against some well known e-commerce platforms, and demonstrate the real world tools used by threat actors today

  title: Breaking Mobile App Defenses with Frida and Reverse Engineering
  name: Shofe Miraz
  org: CyberCX
  anchor: miraz-breaking-mobile-app
  abstract: |-
    Mobile app testing can often be challenging, especially with built-in anti-tampering detection in place. 
    Join us as we will explore the secrets for bypassing these checks and share practical tips for developers 
    to make reverse engineering and tampering mobile application more difficult.
  description: |-
    Are you a mobile app developer interested in safeguarding your app from tampering and reverse engineering 
    attempts? Or are you a security researcher curious about the latest techniques for bypassing anti-tampering 
    libraries in modern mobile applications?
    </p>
    <p>
    After evaluating several mobile applications built using Flutter and similar frameworks, we have noticed the 
    use of anti-tampering libraries, particularly in financial applications, to detect and protect the app from 
    running on modified or higher-privilege devices. While this approach may provide some assurance to 
    companies/developers, it poses a challenge for security researchers who wish to analyze the application's security 
    aspects. Bypassing these checks can also be time-consuming, due to the extensive checks performed by popular 
    frameworks such as IOSSecuritySuite for iOS and Rootbear for Android.
    </p>
    <p>
    In this presentation, we will discuss the difficulties of working with precompiled applications where the 
    source code is not readily available. We will share reverse engineering techniques to identify the functions 
    responsible for the anti-tampering and anti-root detection checks. Furthermore, we will attempt to bypass the 
    checks with the use of a well-known dynamic instrumentation framework, <strong>Frida</strong>. The aim is to 
    demonstrate that, with the appropriate tools and some patience, it is possible to overcome these protection 
    mechanisms.
    </p>
    <p>
    The talk will also provide developers with guidance on making these tampering/reverse engineering efforts 
    more difficult. The primary message is that as it is feasible to bypass most checks with enough time and effort, 
    adding complexity to the app’s security measures can discourage the competition.
    </p>
    <p>
    A few technical aspects are present in this presentation such as the source code of these open-source detection 
    libraries, assembly code, and a demo of the tools in action. While experience with mobile app testing is 
    advantageous, it is not required for this talk.

    <p>
    Kubernetes (K8S) is getting more attention in recent years, due to its fantastic features and supports in driving CI/CD pipelines 
    for organisations and its ability to orchestrate containers. An attacker has multiple ways to attack a K8S cluster, mainly through 
    misconfigurations such as in role based access controls (RBAC) or network policies or vulnerabilities in the containers.
    </p>
    <p>
    In this talk, we will reveal activities going on behind the scene in a K8S cluster review from the perspective of an attacker 
    and will show-case this in various demonstrations. Common threats and attack vectors that could be found in various cluster 
    environments, such as managed and self-managed, will also be dissected and explained to you. The talk will be concluded with 
    some of the established ways that you can use to secure a cluster environment.

    </p>
    <p>
    <em>Join us at Cypher Manor to unravel a murder most mysterious.</em>
    </p>

    This talk will present a deep dive into the revamped OWASP DevSecOps Guidelines. Revolutionise your Cyber Security strategy 
    with OWASP DevSecOps - the game-changing approach that seamlessly integrates security into every stage of software development. 
    Don't settle for less, upgrade to DevSecOps now!
  description: |-
    The OWASP DevSecOps Guidelines project provides a comprehensive set of best practices for integrating security into the DevOps 
    process. This is essential because traditional security measures are often insufficient to protect modern software systems that 
    are deployed frequently and rapidly. By following these guidelines, organizations can better manage risk, reduce vulnerabilities, 
    and ultimately build more secure software. It is crucial for every organization to understand and implement DevSecOps because the 
    cost of a data breach can be devastating - not only in terms of financial loss but also damage to reputation and customer trust. 
    A strong DevSecOps strategy can help organizations prevent breaches before they occur, giving them a competitive advantage and peace of mind.

    As an Application Security Consultant, I've had numerous opportunities over the years, to present training and talks on threat modelling. 
    Over the years, my thinking has evolved, and I've focused on using threat modeling as a source of "consequential" security 
    requirements - security features our applications require <strong>as a consequence</strong> of including a functional capability specified 
    by or on behalf of our users.
    </p>

    The approach I teach and facilitate is based on Adam Shostack's "Four Questions," but has been expanded and (I think) clarified. In this

    It's time to embrace agile methodologies in AppSec! By integrating security into every step of your SDLC, you can quickly 
    detect and respond to vulnerabilities and improve your security posture. Not only will you ensure security, but also 
    enhance collaboration between development and security teams.
  description: |-
    The apparent cultural divide between application security engineers and developers has sparked great debate around the 
    controversial topic of whether embedding security is a potential blocker to the software development lifecycle.
    </p>
    <p>
    In this session, we explore the beauty of integrating agile methodologies with application security to effectively reduce 
    the amount of software released with known vulnerabilities. Both these concepts initially require more of a cultural shift 
    within any organisation before implementing processes and technology, understanding that security engineers are enablers 
    and not blockers aiming to bake security into the SDLC process without affecting deployments negatively.
    </p>
    <p>
    Most importantly, the goal is to effect each change and embed security in each of the SDLC phases in small bite chunks, 
    making sure each step is well crafted, customised and perfected before moving on to the next step after all the whole process 
    is a jungle gym and not a vertical ladder.
