    You know that you should automate AppSec testing in your pipeline. At the very least, you should manually 
    scan your code, but do the specific tools you use matter? Using the OWASP benchmark and our own apps, we'll 
    compare the options and help you decide if the paid options are worth the money.
  description: |-
    The OWASP Benchmark Project is a Java test suite designed to evaluate the accuracy, coverage, and speed of automated software vulnerability detection tools. To enhance the picture the Benchmark provides, we've used open source and commercial Static Application Security Testing (SAST) as well as Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to scan a number of our own applications.
    </p>
    <p>
    In this talk, we'll talk through: 
    <ul>
    <li>How SAST and SCA operate, and the various scanning techniques used by these tools;</li> 
    <li>How commercial SAST vendors fared against the OWASP benchmark, and whether the benchmark false- positive rate results were in line with the results of scanning our own apps;</li> 
    <li>How various commercial SCA options compare to the open-source OWASP Dependency Check tool; and</li> 
    <li>What value (beyond scan output) paid tools provide, compared to their open-source counterparts.</li>

    The OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) enables you to formulate and implement 
    a strategy for software security that is tailored to the risk profile of your organisation. 
    In this talk, we give an overview of the new release of the SAMM model. After 10 years since 
    its first conception, it was important to align it with today's development practices. We 
    will cover a number of topics in the talk:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>the core structure of the model, redesigned and extended to align with modern development practices;</li>
    <li>the measurement model, enhanced to cover both coverage and quality; and</li> 
    <li>the new security practice streams where the SAMM activities are grouped in maturity levels.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    We will demonstrate using the new SAMM2 Toolbox to measure the maturity of an example development 
    team and how you can create a roadmap of activities.
    </p>
    <p>
    Our new SAMM project "CI/CD" pipeline allows us to iterate much faster. We plan to push new SAMM 
    improvements over the coming months. During this talk we will share our short-, medium-, and long-term 
    plans for OWASP SAMM and hope to capture your feedback and requests for improvement.

    Let's implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in a live demo, and understand the pros and cons compared to Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC).

    You're logged in. So is your manager. How does the application make sure that only you and she can access your performance reviews?
    </p>
    <p>
    Often, we'll add roles to users, and lock functionality to those roles. We might call that 
    Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), but in doing so we would ignore the full power and flexibility it provides.
    </p>
    <p>
    Authorisation can be so much more nuanced than that. Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) goes beyond a simple 
    role taxonomy, opening up a featureful complexity that will excite many an auditor.
    </p>
    <p>
    In this session, you will gain an understanding of these two access control systems, under which types of situation 
    they are useful, and experience an RBAC implementation during a live demo.

    Ever been frustrated with having to wrangle yet another password when you sign up for a new site? Ever felt uncomfortable because a website has asked for your banking password just so it can make a single transaction?

    Web developers are quickly finding that using passwords for logins is falling out of fashion in favour of "federated" authentication. These are often quicker, safer and allow users to grant limited access to their stuff on other websites. This is often done using open standards such as **OAuth 2**, **OpenID Connect** and **JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)**.
    </p>
    <p>
    In this talk, we will introduce how to authenticate users to your websites, apps, devices or even between servers using OpenID Connect, and authorise third-party access to some of their resources using OAuth 2. We will also discuss JSON Web Tokens (JWTs, confusingly pronounced "jots"), which we can use as temporary credentials to access APIs and verify identities.

*Slide Deck Coming Soon*   
[Video](https://youtu.be/nQoQzUQ-X1U){: target="videos" } (YouTube, 28:46)

#### Abstract

We pulled together our threat modelling vision and strategy with OWASP best practices (like OWASP SAMM and the AppSec Champion Playbook) to create a 'Threat Modeling Playbook.' It shows you how to turn threat modelling into an established, reliable practice in your development teams.

#### Description

We consider threat modeling a foundational activity to improve your software assurance or product security.

We have trained hundreds of experts and consulted with as many clients regarding threat modeling. We found that a well-established threat modeling practice will measurably decrease security issues of delivered products.

Performing a threat modeling exercise is one thing. Scaling it up as a standard practice in an organization is another. Threat modeling is often considered a manual and costly activity with an unpredictable outcome.

We pulled together our Toreon threat modeling vision and strategy with OWASP best practices (like OWASP SAMM and the AppSec champion playbook) to create a 'Threat modeling playbook.' The playbook shows you how to turn threat modeling into an established, reliable practice in your development teams and in the larger organisation.

We released this as an open source OWASP project for everyone to use and improve upon. We encourage you to download and use our playbook. Try it with your own team or on a pilot project. And let us know how it works and how we can improve the playbook.

With you, we can create a community to support and continuously improve 'Threat modeling playbook.' Together, we can make threat modelling more widely available. This in turn will make all of our software more secure.

### Vulnerability Management 101 with OWASP DefectDojo

Sat 11:30am

*Slide Deck Coming Soon*   
[Video](https://youtu.be/35h8TZweYAM){: target="videos" } (YouTube, 19:21)   

#### Abstract

Numerous public reports show 2020 as the "worst year ever" for data breaches, with a common source being web applications with unpatched vulnerabilities. We will present vulnerability management using OWASP DefectDojo and how we leverage it to protect New Zealand health organisations and beyond.

#### Description

Numerous public reports found 2020 to be the "worst year ever" for data breaches, and with healthcare standing at the forefront during the COVID-19 pandemic response, and rapid digital transformation of healthcare, it is natural the cybersecurity risks will increase and affect healthcare organisations and beyond.

We looked at ways to reduce the attack surface and incident rates of health organisations experiencing security challenges and lack of funding to address this. One of the most common reasons for data/system breaches at small-to-medium organisations is that the vulnerabilities present in their web applications were discovered and exploited by threat actors. For example, the cause of TuOra Compass Health's cybersecurity incident in late 2019 was the exploitation of publically known web server vulnerabilities. 

This presentation will give a brief overview of why web application vulnerability management solutions are essential nowadays; how we leveraged OWASP DefectDojo, cloud infrastructure, and docker containers to build our CyberScan continuous vulnerability management system; how we automate, discover, triage and track vulnerabilities across multiple New Zealand health organisations, teams, and services; and our lessons learned.

### Web Apps: Hardening Too Hard?

[Video](https://youtu.be/5GKcGXPwi04){: target="videos" } (YouTube, 42:53)   

#### Abstract

This talk aims to tackle the low hanging fruit of penetration testing. Identifying those issues that consistently appear and figuring out why they never get fixed. I am hoping to show developers and consultants how simple the fixes can be, while also demonstrating the impact of improper configurations.

#### Description

Almost every web application has these issues: 

* Weak TLS Configuration 
* Lack of Security Headers 
* Version Number Disclosure 
* Exposed Administration Portal 
* Sequential Object Identifiers 
* Lack of CSRF Tokens 
* And on and on and on...

Why are they always here? What is so bad about them? Why should I bother fixing them?

Nick will go over these issues and demonstrate how easy they can be to fix, but also the ways they can break your app. Using the experience of having his colleagues bully every web application he puts together, Nick will talk about the balance that can be found between security and functionality.

The aim is to have a hardened web application, no availability compromises, and really make those penetration testers work for their findings.

### XXE: Why It's Still in the Top 10

Fri 11:45am

*Slide Deck Coming Soon*   
[Video](https://youtu.be/5kzgYSmh9qI){: target="videos" } (YouTube, 20:24)   

#### Abstract

XXE is commonly passed over in normal teaching and educational conference talks, but remains one of the top vulnerabilities for web servers that utilize XML parsers. Recently, we have still been finding applications vulnerable to XML Entity attacks, which this talk will cover in an easy to understand way.

#### Description

XML External Entities (XXEs) have been in the OWASP Top Ten since 2017, however they have existed as a vulnerability class for approximately two decades. Entities within XML can be used to do lots of fun things as an attacker, such as causing a Denial-of-Service, stealing files, or even creating a backdoor.

This talk will cover the basics of what XXEs are, how to exploit them, and importantly for developers, how to prevent them.

Web browser developers now work hard to keep your users and your applications secure. We'll discuss the state-of-the-art defences provided by web browsers, and explain how you can incorporate them into your web applications. You will learn how to fairly easily improve the security of your apps.

#### Description

The makers of Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and other browsers are constantly pushing the envelope in browser security, with new features recently released and under development. Many of these features are simple to incorporate into your application, and this talk will help you keep up with the moving target of staying safe on the Internet.

Over the past 10 years there have been numerous HTTP headers, sandboxing and protection mechanisms added to browsers - so many that it's hard to keep up! It's possible that the best defences you learned in 2011 have been bettered by the new stuff rolling out each month in 2021.

In this talk you'll learn about the old, with a focus on the new and shiny. We will focus on those protections that are available now, and proven by others to work - and have a quick point towards future security enhancements that are coming in the future.

#### Abstract

Everyone has a different story of how they got into Cyber Security. As a student, my impression came straight out of Hollywood with dark rooms and green text rushing down monitors. In this talk I'll pull back the curtain and share my experience getting into the Cyber Security field.

#### Description

With Hollywood fantasizing *hackers* as computer wizards, overloading mainframes and bypassing CPUs, what your average person working in the Cyber Security industry gets up to in the 9-to-5 is shrouded.

In this talk I'll give a fresh take on what it's like getting into Cyber Security. Sharing my experience growing up in a parental controls war for more time on the internet, that one security paper I took at uni, flinging out CVs, convincing someone to give me a job, finding out what a blue team does, studying for my OSCP, and dealing with burnout.
