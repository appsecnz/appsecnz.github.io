    Traditionally security maturity models all suggest that the work is "done" when you reach 
    Level 5. Sadly, nothing could be further from the truth. Security needs to be a cycle/model 
    that continues. We have adapted our maturity model to a vision that outlines continuous  
    improvement to application security, forming the modern security model for success called
    'Continuous Security.'

  anchor: snyk-azure-devops
  description: |-
    We will demonstrate how you can give developers working in the Azure ecosystem a 
    unique security feedback loop, with direct, actionable fixes, from code to cloud, 
    back to code. By connecting observed cloud security insights with developer-driven 
    workflows, developers can prioritize and remediate vulnerabilities faster in Cloud-Native 
    workflows. This results in reduced risk due to more secure cloud environments 
    and increased developer productivity, leading to better and faster innovation.

    In this session we will walk through the newly released Checkmarx Application Security 
    Testing (AST) Platform, providing a one-stop-shop solution for all aspects of Application 
    Security Testing. The demonstration will focus on Static Code Analysis (SAST), Software 
    Composition Analysis (SCA), Infrastructure as Code Analysis (KICS) and their use cases 
    as a part of SDLC, including DevOps (CI/CD) integrations.

    In this session we will demonstrate how shielding works to mitigate specific vulnerabilities. 
    Shields can modify application behaviour and resolve the types of vulnerabilities that are usually 
    left to developers to fix. We will also provide an overview of the RedShield portal, which customers 
    get access to as part of RedShield's service.

    Open-source libraries have become an essential part of almost all modern applications.  
    Without open-source, software development would be stuck in the slow lane. Not "reinventing the 
    wheel" each time you need certain functionality in an app saves time and effort, and as a result, 
    open-source isn't going away anytime soon. If anything, it's becoming more and more widespread.  
    But there's a certain amount of risk that comes with using open source components, modules, and 
    libraries. Today, it's increasingly important to protect yourself from these risks. In this 
    presentation, we will discuss the importance and prevalence of open-source software as well as 
    the ways you can protect yourself from its attendant risks and licensing issues. 
    The goal is to catch issues early, before they can become fatal.

  title: 'How to Avoid Cloud-Native Security Risks with Snyk'
  anchor: snyk-cloud-native 
  description: |-
    Cloud and DevOps practices blur the boundary between application development and the production 
    cloud environment. We will show you how to identify risks coming from vulnerabilities in open-source 
    dependencies and containers and correlate these with cloud misconfigurations in order to find the 
    fastest path to reduce your risk. We will demonstrate how you can avoid top infrastructure-as-code 
    (IaC) misconfigurations from being deployed to your environment and how to identify and remediate
    drift from that known good state.

  description: |-
    Let's make Auth0 unique to our needs, by uploading our own custom code. By modifying the login process 
    as a programming level, we can simplify the work that our applications need to do later. This is a live 
    coding demo, and there might be chocolates for audience members that spot the inevitable bugs. 
    It's like extreme pair programming. Don't miss it!
