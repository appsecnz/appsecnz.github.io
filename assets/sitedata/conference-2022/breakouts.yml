  title: 'Building Security into Your Azure DevOps Practice with Snyk' 
  anchor: snyk-azure-devops
  description: |-
    We will demonstrate how you can give developers working in the Azure ecosystem a 
    unique security feedback loop, with direct, actionable fixes, from code to cloud, 
    back to code. By connecting observed cloud security insights with developer-driven 
    workflows, developers can prioritize and remediate vulnerabilities faster in cloud 
    native workflows. This results in reduced risk due to more secure cloud environments 
    and increased developer productivity, leading to better and faster innovation.

    Open-source libraries have become an essential part of almost all modern applications.  
    Without open-source, software development would be stuck in the slow lane. Not "reinventing the 
    wheel" each time you need certain functionality in an app saves time and effort, and as a result, 
    open-source isn't going away anytime soon. If anything, it's becoming more and more widespread.  
    But there's a certain amount of risk that comes with using open source components, modules, and 
    libraries. Today, it's increasingly important to protect yourself from these risks. In this 
    presentation, we will discuss the importance and prevalence of open-source software as well as 
    the ways you can protect yourself from its attendant risks and licensing issues. 
    The goal is to catch issues early, before they can become fatal.

  title: 'How to Avoid Cloud-Native Security Risks with Snyk'
  anchor: snyk-cloud-native 
  description: |-
    Cloud and DevOps practices blur the boundary between application development and the production 
    cloud environment. We will show you how to identify risks coming from vulnerabilities in open-source 
    dependencies and containers and correlate these with cloud misconfigurations in order to find the 
    fastest path to reduce your risk. We will demonstrate how you can avoid top infrastructure-as-code 
    (IaC) misconfigurations from being deployed to your environment and how to identify and remediate
    drift from that known good state.
