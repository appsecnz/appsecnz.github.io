    The migration of software from monoliths to microservices is long behind us, however managing 
    microservices operations at scale comes with a layer of complexity, particularly with aspects 
    of security that still have a learning curve. But what if all of this could be simplified and 
    automated pretty easily?
  description: |-
    If we think about our production Kubernetes and microservices operations, in the same way we 
    think about how we design and build our products, we could build and automate minimum viable 
    security plans that we could easily bake into our config files and CI/CD processes. Once we 
    build this foundational framework of security, it will always be possible to iterate and evolve 
    our security framework, for advanced layers of security that often comes with time, increased 
    experience, and greater maturity around security.
    </p>
    <p>
    In this talk, we will present what MVS looks like for Kubernetes operations, how to build a 
    cluster secured by design, continuously monitoring networking, container internals and primitives, 
    and access management with a least privilege principle mindset. In this session we will demonstrate 
    this through code, and even how this can work seamlessly with other CNCF ecosystem projects - 
    from Helm to OPA, ArgoCD, Notary, as well at the most common DevOps stacks - Terraform, to AWS, 
    Github Actions and more.

    During an incident, knowing your external perimeter is critical when trying to determine 
    your attack surface, and OWASP Amass is a tool that can be used to help perform this at 
    speed and scale. I will give an overview of OWASP Amass and how and why this should be 
    used to assist organizations.
  description: |-
    For many organizations, knowing what their external perimeter is can be an ongoing challenge. 
    A lack of asset management, shadow IT and disjointed internal teams remain almost ever-present, 
    especially in older and larger enterprises. It's therefore not uncommon for a range of different 
    applications or websites to be accessible on the wider internet without security teams being 
    aware of them, or without sufficient logging in place to detect and respond to malicious activity 
    targeting these sites.
    </p>
    <p>
    So what happens when a remote code execution vulnerability is disclosed in log4j, a near-ubiquitous 
    logging framework for Java? When you suddenly find yourself in a position where Internet-facing 
    applications are being exploited en masse, but you don’t have a clear idea of what you even have 
    on the internet to begin with?
    </p>
    <p>
    Enter OWASP Amass - a tool to help information security professionals perform network mapping 
    of attack surfaces and perform external asset discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
    In this talk will give an overview of OWASP Amass along with how and why security or development 
    teams should use it. I will also discuss a real-world use case on how OWASP Amass was utilized 
    during Westpac's incident response to the now infamous log4j vulnerability, allowing us to rapidly 
    map out our external perimeter to identify potentially vulnerable targets on the internet.

  abstract: |- 
    As engineering systems and processes continue to grow in speed and diversity, security teams 
    are struggling to understand this ecosystem well enough to provide good security guardrails. 
    I suggest a new approach to securing engineering environments, covering all relevant aspects of CI/CD security.
  description: |-
    CI/CD pipelines are quickly becoming the path of least resistance for would-be attackers into 
    sensitive internal systems, gaining access to critical data, with minimal effort.
    </p>
    <p>
    In the InfoSec world, when we talk about CI/CD security, often times this focuses on specific 
    aspects of securing your pipeline - scanning the code, protecting secrets, securely managing code 
    deployments, or even authentication and authorization mechanisms, but we rarely talk about all of these together.
    </p>
    <p>
    After years of being in the trenches and realizing that the attack surface is growing and the threat 
    landscape becoming more and more complex, it has become increasingly apparent that security teams 
    need to adapt and modify strategies to keep up with the new reality of CI/CD protection, without compromising developer velocity.
    </p>
    <p>
    In this talk, I would like to propose a new way of thinking about CI/CD security - that encompasses 
    the three disciplines that comprise CI/CD security - security in the pipeline, of the pipeline, and 
    around the pipeline. Partial coverage of any or all of these disciplines simply will not cut it with 
    the continuously evolving risk landscape. Security engineers need to address each of these aspects in 
    their entirety to provide the full scope of coverage that modern organizations need, and I will take a 
    deep dive on the challenges each introduce, and the approaches and techniques for mitigating them based 
    on adversarial security research.

    Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) allows attackers to interact with your internal systems

    Top 10. We discuss why this specific individual vulnerability deserves its place on the Top 10, and 
    how developers can protect against it.
  description: |-
    As the only individual vulnerability in the 2021 OWASP Top 10, why was it number one in the community surveys?
    </p>
    <p>
    A SSRF attack involves an attacker using your Internet-facing services to send requests on their behalf. 
    Because this can generates requests from your own service, it can provide access to hosts on your internal network.
    </p>
    <p>
    Despite being a single vulnerability, SSRF allows attackers to: 
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>Retrieve your cloud environment metadata;</li>
    <li>Access your internal databases;</li>
    <li>Access your internal management web applications; and</li>
    <li>Bypass your perimeter firewalls.</li>
    </ul>

    I am sure all of you have heard about "Shift Left Security" in many presentations, but how do you 
    actually achieve this? Well, this is the talk for you - where I'll cover all the DevSecOps buzzwords 
    and showcase a functional DevSecOps pipeline that can perform security testing such as SCA, SAST, and DAST.
  description: |-
    In this talk I'll cover how to build your first DevSecOps pipeline with Open Source tooling. 
    I'll address various concepts and buzzwords related to DevSecOps to clear your doubts. 
    I'll demonstrate a GitLab pipeline that has various open-source security tooling embedded to 
    perform the following security tests against a vulnerable application:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>Secrets Detection (tools such as Trufflehog, etc.)</li>
    <li>Software Composition Analysis (SCA)</li>
    <li>Static Application Security Testing (SAST)</li>
    <li>Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    With this pipeline, our aim is to identify security issues as early as possible so that we 
    can build "Secure by Default" products. This pipeline and demos will cover tools such as 
    retireJS, Safety, Bandit, TruffleHog, NMAP, SSLyze and ZAP.

    In May and June of 2022, the author's team collected data through our inaugural <strong>State of Application 
    Security in New Zealand</strong> industry survey. This presentation will outline our objectives
    and methodology, summarise the survey results, and highlight New Zealand enterprises'
    successes - and opportunities for improvement - in securing the software we rely on. 
  description: |-
    There are any number of 'experts' and textbooks on application security (AppSec), ready to tell you all the
    things we <em>should be</em> doing to secure your organisation's applications and data. But, how do the things 
    you're <em>actually doing</em> stack up against what others New Zealand businesses do?
    </p>
    <p>
    To help answer this question, our team has developed the <strong>State of Application Security in New Zealand</strong>
    industry survey. Data collection for 2022's inaugural survey took place in May and June of this year. The 
    survey's content and presentation are intended to serve a two-fold purpose - first, to gain an understanding of
    the general state of AppSec practices around New Zealand; and second, to give New Zealand 
    organisations a way to reflect on their AppSec practices and how they compare to what others are doing.
    </p>

    This presentation will outline our objectives
    and methodology, summarise the survey results, and highlight New Zealand enterprises'
    successes - and opportunities for improvement - in securing the software we rely on.

    Doing security for a small business can seem daunting when enterprise software costs hundreds, 
    thousands, or hundreds of thousands of dollars, and that's before you even get into buying 
    security-specific devices like firewalls or logging servers. But you shouldn't let the idea 
    of 'perfect' security prevent you from taking simple, and often free, steps to improve the 
    security of your business to be 'good enough.'

    One of the most serious issues in web security would be when your database credentials are exposed,

    credentials to the world. Come and see how that could happen - and how to prevent it from happening.

    With the rise of JavaScript frameworks and cloud storage technologies, more and more modern web 
    applications are choosing to access the database directly from the JavaScript client. How can that 
    be done without compromising the security of the application? In this talk, we will look at a real-life 
    case study from a security review, where a failure to secure the database communication could have had 
    devastating consequences for the organisation. We will also cover the security best practices of how to 
    implement client-side communication with cloud storage services, with a focus on AWS S3 buckets.

    Everyone loves cheese, right? This talk will apply the Swiss cheese model to AppSec, each cheese slice 
    is a security activity, a layer of the defenses there to reduce the risk of threats becoming reality 
    and prevent vulnerabilities from various sources making their way into production systems.
  description: |-
    This talk leans on some of my background in aviation maintenance and safety software as aviation is 
    one of the places where the Swiss cheese model originated. It has also been used more recently to model 
    the COVID pandemic defenses. I will apply the model here to describe how we can use security activities 
    in the application development lifecycle to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities getting into production 
    systems. Each slice of the cheese being a security activity, each hole being a gap in the defenses that
    a vulnerability might slip through. It will describe some parts of the model and how they could apply 
    to the application security context. 
    </p>
    <p>
    No new ground-breaking security activities here; just all the good stuff championed by OWASP and 
    explaining how these can fit into common software development lifecycles. Covering how vulnerabilities 
    might still slip through and looking at some of the Human Factors that influence the effectiveness of 
    the defenses. What could be the next slice of cheese that might catch the vulnerability and avoid an 
    incident later in the development lifecycle. Sharing some of my experience in understanding when to 
    do each activity and the problems I've previously encountered in working with development teams to 
    introduce application security programs.

    Vulnerabilities can be manifold and everywhere - in your repo, in your IPA, or when using the app. This talk 
    will guide you on how to start to embed methodologies and open-source security tools into your SDLC to catch 
    the "low-hanging fruits" early and have continuous security scans in your pipeline for iOS Apps.
    </p>
    <p>
    We will go through many practical examples of how to use Github Actions, different open-source tools and 
    leverage the power of SARIF (Static Analysis Results Interchange Format) to get your pipeline in full swing.
    </p>
    <p>
    We start with by identifying secrets and how the scanning for them can be initiated even before being committed
    into the repo. Together with Software Composition Analysis (SCA) of the package managers being used and Static 
    Application Security Testing (SAST) of the source code Github Action will be used to trigger all of the scans 
    automatically with each commit and Pull Request.
    </p>
    <p>
    Implementing and starting scans in your CI/CD is setting the foundation, but managing the vulnerabilities is as 
    important as detecting them. In another demonstration we use the SARIF file format and Github Code Scanning to 
    flag false positives and bring sanity into the vulnerability management process.
    </p>
    <p>
    We will conclude this talk by giving tips and tricks on how to handle the tool output, current limitations of 
    the tools and which identified vulnerabilities you should be focusing on first.

    </p>
    <p>
    The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) is a flagship project, run by a team of volunteers 
    under the OWASP umbrella. It has grown from strength to strength, and is now the most common 
    ruleset used on web application firewalls (WAFs) today. It can be used on ModSecurity in Apache 
    or nginx, in the new WAF Coraza, and is also used by many cloud and CDN providers as part of 
    their own WAF offerings.
    </p>
    <p>
    log4j gave us a good opportunity to understand the benefits and limitations of a web application 
    firewall, to understand how rules and evasions work, and to see the benefits of being able to 
    react quickly to issues.
    </p>
    <p>
    This talk will introduce the ModSecurity and Coraza WAFs, discuss the Core Rule Set's approach 
    to web application security, and discuss the specifics of the log4j vulnerabilities and how 
    they could be defended.

    But how do you build in proactive, preventative measures when you're strapped for money, talent, 
    and guidance? In this talk I'll walk through a brief history of pentesting, its importance, and 
    why automation alone isn’t good enough:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>why pentesting is imperative in today's modern software development cycles;</li>
    <li>the necessity and value of pentesting at scale; and</li>
    <li>practical tips to actually achieve pentesting at a scale.</li>
    </ul>

    During engagements, we often encounter non-standard configurations. These could lead to massive 
    risks, due to the vulnerabilities they might introduce. Today I will demonstrate a number of bugs 
    in popular content management systems (CMS) like Umbraco and how following security best practices 
    might save some remediation effort.
  description: |-
    After reviewing a number of popular Content Management Systems (CMS), I identified exploits that 
    were exposed due to the non-standard configuration that the client had implemented. These non-standard 
    setups are not uncommon and are often introduced without sufficient security considerations.
    </p>
    <p>
    This talk will walk the audience through a number of points across two scenarios, namely:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    A number of underlying Broken Access Control issues found in Umbraco CMS leading to Administrative
    account takeover. While this issue resided within the Umbraco source code, it was only exposed due 
    to a specific implementation that the client had made. I will discuss the underlying issue, how it 
    was exploitable, its effect on the customer, and the changes that both the client and Umbraco made 
    to resolve this issue.
    </li>
    <li>
    A customer introduced a custom file delete function for their cloud storage. Due to a lack of user 
    input sanitization, this led to remote command injection in the backend server. The application was 
    using the Laravel framework; however, the issue originated from an extension of this framework and 
    the use of an unsafe PHP function. I will discuss the underlying issue, the exploit and its effects, 
    and the advice provided to the customer.
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Along with these scenarios, the message to the audience will be, "Often the default configuration 
    and security best practices can provide a better outcome while saving some remediation effort.""
    </p>
    <p>
    This will be a technical presentation assuming, the audience's basic understanding of the common 
    web application security risks. The talk will include some source code snippets to identify 
    the root cause of the issues.
