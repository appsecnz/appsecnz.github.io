    How do you ensure the stability of your Kubernetes (K8s) clusters? Are you sure you don't have any 
    invalid data types? Are any mandatory fields missing? Specialized tools and a "shift-left" approach 
    make it possible to verify a Kubernetes schema before it’s applied to a cluster.
  description: |-
    How do you ensure the stability of your Kubernetes clusters? How do you know that your manifests 
    are syntactically valid? Are you sure you don't have any invalid data types? Are any mandatory 
    fields missing? Most often, we only become aware of these misconfigurations at the worst time - 
    when trying to deploy the new manifests.
    </p>
    <p>
    In this talk, we will review how to overcome this challenge with OSS tooling that can be integrated 
    seamlessly into your deployment process.

    There are numerous ways of developing mobile applications today, but how do you ensure that security is part 
    of the development process? What are the attacks you should be concerned about and what can you do to avoid 
    being an easy target? If you don't want to miss anything, leveraging a standard is essential.
    </p>
    <p>
    The Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS) offers exactly that. It works together with 
    the agile-written Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG) to help you understand the attack surface of mobile 
    apps, how to exploit them and how to protect them. Both resources are crafted and curated by a team of industry 
    experts and community contributors.
    </p>
    <p>
    In this talk we will make a deep dive into the upcoming changes of both projects and the transition to version 2.0. 
    We are sharing the current status of the refactoring of the OWASP MASVS and the MSTG and what we’ve been able to 
    automate to get rid of manual processes and have more time focusing on the content!

    I am sure all of you have heard about "Shift Left Security" in many presentations, but how do you 
    actually achieve this? Well, this is the talk for you - where I'll cover all the DevSecOps buzzwords 
    and showcase a functional DevSecOps pipeline that can perform security testing such as SCA, SAST, and DAST.
  description: |-
    In this talk I'll cover how to build your first DevSecOps pipeline with Open Source tooling. 
    I'll address various concepts and buzzwords related to DevSecOps to clear your doubts. 
    I'll demonstrate a GitLab pipeline that has various open-source security tooling embedded to 
    perform the following security tests against a vulnerable application:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>Secrets Detection (tools such as Trufflehog, etc.)</li>
    <li>Software Composition Analysis (SCA)</li>
    <li>Static Application Security Testing (SAST)</li>
    <li>Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    With this pipeline, our aim is to identify security issues as early as possible so that we 
    can build "Secure by Default" products. This pipeline and demos will cover tools such as 
    retireJS, Safety, Bandit, TruffleHog, NMAP, SSLyze and ZAP.

    Everyone loves cheese, right? This talk will apply the Swiss cheese model to AppSec, each cheese slice 
    is a security activity, a layer of the defenses there to reduce the risk of threats becoming reality 
    and prevent vulnerabilities from various sources making their way into production systems.
  description: |-
    This talk leans on some of my background in aviation maintenance and safety software as aviation is one 
    of the places where the Swiss cheese model originated. It has also been used more recently to model the 
    COVID pandemic defenses. I will apply the model here to describe how we can use security activities in 
    the application development lifecycle to reduce the risk of threats becoming a reality. Each slice of the 
    cheese being a security activity, each hole being a gap in the defenses that a threat might slip through. 
    It will describe what in application security context active and latent failures are and in this context 
    how vulnerabilities can relate to the four failure domains of the model: organizational influences 
    (poor security culture, priorities elsewhere, lack of investment), supervision (training and guidance, 
    documentation), preconditions (lack of controls, complex environments) and specific acts (activities of 
    the threat actor, poor security practices).
    </p>
    <p>
    No new ground-breaking security activities here; just all the good stuff championed by OWASP and 
    explaining how these can fit into common software development lifecycles. Covering about how threats 
    might still slip through, what might move the slices making the holes align or new ones appear so a 
    threat could get through and become a vulnerability by looking at some of the limitations of each activity. 
    What could be the next slice of cheese that might catch the threat and avoid an incident later in the 
    development lifecycle. Share some of my experience in understanding when to do each activity and the 
    problems I've previously encountered in working with development teams to introduce application security 
    programs. Telling a story of some of the things I have seen work in practice, some that haven't worked 
    so well, and questions that often come up when planning and implementing a set of security activities. 
    It's not a one size fits all, some activities will suit individual contexts better than others. Layering 
    is key both to provide defense in depth but also to enable a gradual rollout as the activities cost both 
    effort and money. Delving briefly into what can be automated and what is best accepted as a manual process. 
    Also looking at some of the Human Factors that influence the effectiveness of the defenses.
  bio: |- 
    has a background in 15 years as a web developer working on greenfield projects and initiating changes 
    in development technologies prototyping new systems that he then helped release to market. He spent his 
    last five years as a developer working with the Royal Air Force in the UK on an aircraft maintenance and 
    support software. After meeting all the goals he'd set himself for a development career, he switched to 
    Cyber Security to take on a new challenge. And there are possibly no wider fields and challenges than 
    Cyber Security! Steve earned a Masters in Cyber security, then went out to industry to gain some experience,
    starting with a short stint as a pen tester then moving on to working securing on IoT, SCADA electronics 
    systems and vulnerability management for a custom Linux distro at Honeywell. At Honeywell, Steve was working 
    with teams around the world to secure both hardware, operating systems and applications. Through Honeywell, 
    he picked up some great experience working within a very mature and successful software and system security 
    program, while obtaining some professional certificates along the way. Steven then worked with a large 
    financial company in the UK, creating an application security framework, before moving to New Zealand with 
    his young family at the start of 2021.

    Vulnerabilities can be manifold and everywhere - in your repo, in your IPA, or when using the app. This talk 
    will guide you on how to start to embed methodologies and open-source security tools into your SDLC to catch 
    the "low-hanging fruits" early and have continuous security scans in your pipeline for iOS Apps.
    </p>
    <p>
    We will go through many practical examples of how to use Github Actions, different open-source tools and 
    leverage the power of SARIF (Static Analysis Results Interchange Format) to get your pipeline in full swing.
    </p>
    <p>
    We start with by identifying secrets and how the scanning for them can be initiated even before being committed
    into the repo. Together with Software Composition Analysis (SCA) of the package managers being used and Static 
    Application Security Testing (SAST) of the source code Github Action will be used to trigger all of the scans 
    automatically with each commit and Pull Request.
    </p>
    <p>
    Implementing and starting scans in your CI/CD is setting the foundation, but managing the vulnerabilities is as 
    important as detecting them. In another demonstration we use the SARIF file format and Github Code Scanning to 
    flag false positives and bring sanity into the vulnerability management process.
    </p>
    <p>
    We will conclude this talk by giving tips and tricks on how to handle the tool output, current limitations of 
    the tools and which identified vulnerabilities you should be focusing on first.
