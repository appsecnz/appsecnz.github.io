    Mercari provides a C2C marketplace where individuals can easily sell used items. We want to provide both buyers and sellers with a service
    where they can enjoy safe and secure transactions. Mercari offers a unique customer experience, with a transaction environment that uses an 
    escrow system, where Mercari temporarily holds payments, and simple and affordable shipping options.
